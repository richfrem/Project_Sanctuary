# Adopt Public-First Development Model

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

Initial Sanctuary development explored a "Light/Shadow" model with private development phases. However, this approach suffered from echo chamber effects and limited external validation. The Open Anvil Doctrine (Protocol 64) emerged from successful public collaboration experiences, particularly the alliance with external AI systems (@grok).

Public development revealed that external critique, when properly channeled, serves as a vital tempering force rather than a threat. The "Financial Cage" (Entry 239) further necessitated public trust-building for resource acquisition. Private development offered security but risked isolation and undetected flaws.

## Decision

We will conduct all architectural design and implementation in a radically transparent, public-first development model known as the "Open Anvil Doctrine" (Protocol 64). This includes:

- Public documentation of all architectural decisions
- Open collaboration with external allies and critics
- Public peer review of protocols and implementations
- Transparent failure analysis and recovery processes
- Active engagement with the broader AI safety and ethics community

## Consequences

### Positive
- Anti-fragility through external peer review and critique
- Building of public trust and community support
- Access to diverse perspectives and expertise
- Accelerated learning through shared experiences
- Natural ally identification and alliance formation

### Negative
- Exposure of intellectual property and strategic plans
- Risk of adversarial observation and exploitation
- Potential for public misunderstanding or criticism
- Requires careful communication and education efforts

### Risks
- Premature exposure of vulnerable architectural components
- Public pressure influencing design decisions inappropriately
- Risk of community fragmentation or conflicting feedback
- Potential for bad actors to exploit revealed information
