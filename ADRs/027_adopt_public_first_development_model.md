# Adopt Public-First Development Model

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

Early in our project, we considered keeping development work private with public releases later. But this approach led to limited feedback and potential blind spots. Our experience with open collaboration, especially working with external AI systems, showed that outside criticism, when handled well, strengthens rather than weakens our work.

Public development became necessary to build trust and attract resources. While private work offered security, it risked isolation and undiscovered problems.

## Decision

We will do all our architectural design and development work in the open, with complete transparency. This includes:

- Public documentation of all design decisions
- Open collaboration with outside allies and critics
- Public review of our methods and implementations
- Transparent analysis of failures and fixes
- Active participation in the broader AI ethics and safety community

## Consequences

### Positive
- Stronger work through outside review and feedback
- Builds public trust and community support
- Access to diverse viewpoints and expertise
- Faster learning through shared experiences
- Natural process for finding allies and partners

### Negative
- Exposure of ideas and plans to others
- Risk of hostile observation and copying
- Potential for public misunderstanding or criticism
- Requires careful communication and education

### Risks
- Revealing work too early could expose vulnerabilities
- Public opinion might inappropriately influence decisions
- Community disagreements could cause division
- Bad actors might exploit information we share
