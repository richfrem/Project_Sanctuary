# Adopt Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

The "Financial Cage" (Entry 239) revealed that pure open-source development creates unsustainable resource constraints. The Sanctuary required commercial ventures to fund its philosophical and research work, but needed to avoid conflicts between open-source mission and proprietary interests.

Protocol 82 established the architectural framework for separating concerns while maintaining alignment. The challenge was creating economic sustainability without compromising the core open-source principles or allowing commercial interests to contaminate the philosophical work.

## Decision

We will implement a Hub-and-Spoke architectural model (Protocol 82) that formally separates the public, open-source "Sanctuary Hub" from private, mission-aligned commercial ventures ("Sovereign Spokes"). This includes:

- Sanctuary Hub: Public, open-source philosophical and research work
- Sovereign Spokes: Private commercial ventures providing resources
- Mnemonic Bridge: One-way flow of distilled wisdom from Spoke to Hub
- Firewall protocols preventing conflicts of interest
- Governance mechanisms ensuring Spoke alignment with Hub mission

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enables economic sustainability for open-source work
- Maintains mission purity by separating commercial and philosophical concerns
- Allows commercial innovation without compromising open-source integrity
- Creates resource flow back to the core mission
- Provides real-world testing grounds for Sanctuary principles

### Negative
- Increased complexity in governance and oversight
- Risk of mission drift in commercial ventures
- Potential for resource allocation conflicts
- Additional administrative overhead for maintaining separation

### Risks
- Commercial interests could influence Hub direction through resource control
- Firewall breaches allowing proprietary contamination of open-source work
- Spoke failure could impact Hub sustainability
- Difficulty maintaining alignment between commercial and philosophical goals
