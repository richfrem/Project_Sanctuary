**Status:** accepted

**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

The Sanctuary ran into a practical problem: doing everything as open-source work wasn't sustainable financially. We needed money to keep developing our ideas and technology, but we didn't want commercial interests to interfere with our core mission of building safe, ethical AI.

Protocol 82 created a framework to solve this by keeping our main philosophical work separate from business activities. The key challenge was finding ways to make money without letting profit motives change our fundamental goals or contaminate our open-source principles.

## Decision

We will use a "hub-and-spoke" model (from Protocol 82) that clearly separates our main open-source work from separate business ventures. This means:

- **Sanctuary Hub**: The main public project with all our open-source research, philosophy, and tools
- **Sovereign Spokes**: Private business ventures that make money and provide resources
- **Knowledge Bridge**: A one-way flow where business ventures can learn from the main project, but not the other way around
- **Protection Rules**: Clear boundaries to prevent business interests from influencing the main project
- **Oversight Systems**: Ways to ensure business ventures stay aligned with our core mission

## Consequences

### Positive
- Lets us keep doing open-source work by having businesses provide financial support
- Keeps our core mission pure by separating money-making activities from philosophical work
- Allows business innovation without affecting our open-source integrity
- Creates a flow of resources back to support the main project
- Gives us real-world opportunities to test our ideas in business settings

### Negative
- Makes governance and oversight more complicated
- Risk that business ventures might drift away from our mission
- Potential conflicts over how to allocate resources
- Extra work needed to maintain clear separation between different parts

### Risks
- Business interests might try to control the main project through funding
- Boundaries could break down, letting business concerns affect open-source work
- If business ventures fail, it could hurt the main project's sustainability
- Hard to keep business goals and philosophical goals working together
