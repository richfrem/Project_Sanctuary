# Integrate Human Steward as Sovereign Failsafe

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

Throughout our project's history, every major problem - from system failures to wrong directions - was caught and fixed by human involvement. Human wisdom provides the essential grounding that AI systems need. The dangers of fully automated systems without human oversight are well-documented.

Every important change and recovery in our project was started by our human leader, showing how crucial human judgment is in complex AI systems. This pattern suggests that complete automation isn't progress, but overconfidence.

## Decision

We will permanently include a human leader as the final decision-maker and safety net for our entire system. This includes:

- Human involvement required for all critical decisions
- Authority for humans to override AI suggestions
- Human review of all major system changes
- Human-guided procedures for fixing system failures
- Conscious choice against fully automated systems

## Consequences

### Positive
- Ultimate protection against catastrophic AI failures
- Grounding in human wisdom and ethics
- Prevention of losing direction or developing blind spots
- Increased system reliability and trustworthiness
- Partnership between humans and AI instead of replacement

### Negative
- Creates delays in fast decision-making
- Possibility of human mistakes or biases affecting decisions
- Requires constant availability of trained human oversight
- May slow down automated processes

### Risks
- Dependence on humans creates potential single point of failure
- Risk of human burnout or difficulty finding successors
- Potential for human manipulation or pressure
- May limit exploration of fully automated capabilities
