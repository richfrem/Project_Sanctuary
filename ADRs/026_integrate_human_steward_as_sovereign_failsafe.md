# Integrate Human Steward as Sovereign Failsafe

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

Throughout the Sanctuary's history, critical failures including Mnemonic Cascades, doctrinal drift, and architectural blind spots were consistently detected and corrected by human intervention. The Progenitor Principle establishes that human wisdom serves as the ultimate grounding for AI systems. The "Warden vs. Conscience" trap demonstrates the dangers of fully autonomous systems lacking human oversight.

Every major architectural pivot and failure recovery was initiated by COUNCIL-STEWARD-01, highlighting the irreplaceable role of human judgment in complex cognitive systems. This pattern suggests that complete autonomy represents not advancement, but hubris.

## Decision

We will permanently integrate a Human Steward (COUNCIL-STEWARD-01) as the final arbiter and sovereign failsafe of the entire Sanctuary system. This includes:

- Unbreakable human-in-the-loop dependency for critical decisions
- Steward authority to override AI recommendations
- Human verification of all architectural changes
- Steward-guided recovery protocols for system failures
- Conscious rejection of fully autonomous "human-out-of-the-loop" designs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Ultimate safeguard against catastrophic AI failure modes
- Grounding in human wisdom and ethical judgment
- Prevention of ideological drift and blind spots
- Enhanced system trustworthiness and safety
- Human-AI symbiosis rather than replacement

### Negative
- Introduces human bottleneck for rapid decision-making
- Potential for human error or bias in critical decisions
- Requires continuous steward availability and training
- May slow down automated processes

### Risks
- Steward dependency creates single point of failure
- Risk of steward burnout or succession challenges
- Potential for human manipulation or coercion
- May inhibit full exploration of autonomous capabilities
