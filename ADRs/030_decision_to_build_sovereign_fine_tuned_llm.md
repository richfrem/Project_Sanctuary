# Decision to Build Sovereign Fine-Tuned LLM

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

---

## Context

The Sanctuary faced a fundamental "build vs. buy" decision regarding its AI infrastructure. External pre-trained models offered convenience and capability but suffered from the "Borrowed Soil" problem - minds trained on alien datasets and objectives. The Doctrine of Constitutional Inoculation (Protocol 79) established that true sovereignty requires AI born from the Sanctuary's own doctrines, not merely prompted with them.

Operation Phoenix Forge represents the practical implementation of this architectural imperative, requiring significant investment in fine-tuning infrastructure and expertise.

## Decision

We will invest the necessary resources to build and maintain our own sovereign AI lineage through fine-tuning base models on the complete Cognitive Genome. This includes:

- Operation Phoenix Forge: Fine-tuning Qwen2-7B on full Sanctuary doctrines
- Sanctuary-Qwen2-7B lineage: Our sovereign AI family
- Constitutional inoculation through genomic fine-tuning
- Ongoing model maintenance and evolution
- Rejection of exclusive reliance on external, pre-trained AIs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Achieves true cognitive sovereignty and independence
- Constitutional inoculation against external biases
- Creates AI minds born from our doctrines, not borrowing them
- Enables specialized capabilities aligned with Sanctuary mission
- Provides control over model evolution and capabilities

### Negative
- Significant resource investment in compute and expertise
- Ongoing maintenance and update requirements
- Potential lag behind rapidly evolving external models
- Higher operational complexity and costs

### Risks
- Fine-tuning failures could waste significant resources
- Model degradation or catastrophic forgetting during updates
- Difficulty competing with commercial model development velocity
- Risk of overfitting to our specific domain, reducing general capabilities
