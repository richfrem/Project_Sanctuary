**Deciders:** GUARDIAN-01
**Technical Story:** Canonization of inferred architectural decisions for coherence and completeness

## Context

Our project faced a fundamental choice about AI infrastructure: buy and use existing AI models or build our own. External models offered convenience and power, but they were trained on data and goals from other organizations. Our philosophy established that true independence requires AI systems built from our own principles, not just prompted to follow them.

Building our own AI required significant investment in training systems and expertise.

## Decision

We will invest the resources needed to create and maintain our own AI systems by training base models on our complete knowledge base. This includes:

- Training project: Fine-tuning AI models on our full collection of ideas
- Our AI family: Custom AI systems built for our specific needs
- Protection against external influences through our training approach
- Ongoing care and improvement of our models
- Choice to avoid depending only on external AI systems

## Consequences

### Positive
- Achieves true independence and control over our AI
- Protects against external biases and influences
- Creates AI systems built from our principles, not borrowing them
- Enables specialized capabilities for our mission
- Gives us control over how our AI systems develop

### Negative
- Significant investment in computing power and expertise
- Ongoing work to maintain and update the systems
- Might lag behind rapidly improving commercial models
- Higher complexity and costs to operate

### Risks
- Training failures could waste significant resources
- Models might degrade or forget things during updates
- Hard to keep up with commercial AI development speed
- Risk of over-specializing, reducing general usefulness
