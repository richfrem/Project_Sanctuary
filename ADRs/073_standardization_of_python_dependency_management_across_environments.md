# Standardization of Python Dependency Management Across Environments

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Author:** AI Assistant
**Related Tasks:** Task 146, Task 147

**Summary:** Each service owns one runtime `requirements.txt` used consistently across all execution environments, while shared dependencies are versioned centrally via a common core.

---

## Core Principles

1.  **Every service/container owns its runtime dependencies**
    *   Ownership is expressed via one `requirements.txt` per service.
    *   This file is the single source of truth, regardless of how the service is run.
2.  **Execution environment does not change dependency logic**
    *   Docker, Podman, .venv, and direct terminal execution must all install from the same `requirements.txt`.
    *   "Each service defines its own runtime world."
3.  **Shared versions are centralized, runtime ownership remains local**

---

## Context

We are facing significant "Dependency Chaos" across the Project Sanctuary fleet.
Currently, Python requirements are managed ad-hoc across:
1.  **Container Dockerfiles**: 8 separate Dockerfiles (Sanctuary Cortex, Git, Filesystem, etc.), some defining dependencies manually via `pip install`, others using local `requirements.txt`.
2.  **Local Environments**: A root `/requirements.txt` exists but doesn't match container environments.
3.  **Source Code Directories**: Individual generic server codes (e.g., `mcp_servers/rag_cortex/requirements.txt`) have their own lists.
4.  **Redundancy**: `sanctuary_cortex/Dockerfile` currently installs from `requirements.txt` AND executes a manual `pip install` list of the exact same packages, increasing maintenance burden and confusion.
5.  **Build Efficiency**: Dockerfiles were previously ordered incorrectly (`COPY code` -> `RUN pip install`), invalidating caches on every code change. (Fixed in `sanctuary_{cortex,filesystem,git,network,utils}` on 2025-12-23).

**Scope**: This policy applies equally to:
*   Docker / Podman
*   .venv-based execution
*   Direct terminal execution

Dockerfiles are not special — they are just one consumer of `requirements.txt`.

## Options Analysis

### Option A: Distributed/Manual (Current Status Quo)
- **Description**: Each Dockerfile manually lists its own packages (`RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn...`).
- **Pros**: Zero coupling between services.
- **Cons**: High maintenance. Inconsistent versions across the fleet. High risk of "it works on my machine" vs. container. Redundant layer caching is minimal.

### Option B: Unified "Golden" Requirements
- **Description**: A single `requirements-fleet.txt` used by ALL 8 containers.
- **Pros**: Absolute consistency. Simplified logic. Maximum Docker layer sharing if base images match.
- **Cons**: Bloated images. `sanctuary_utils` (simple) inherits heavy ML deps from `rag_cortex` (complex). Security risk surface area increases unnecessarily for simple tools.

### Option C: Tiered "Base vs. Specialized" (Recommended)
- **Description**:
    *   **Tier 1 (Common)**: A `requirements-common.txt` (fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, mcp) used by all.
    *   **Tier 2 (Specialized)**: Specific files for heavy lifters (e.g., `requirements-cortex.txt` for ML/RAG).
- **Pros**: Balances consistency with efficiency. Keeps lightweight containers light.
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex build context (need to mount/copy the common file).

### Option D: Dockerfile-Specific Requirements (Strict Mapping)
- **Description**: Every Dockerfile `COPY`s exactly one `requirements.txt` that lives next to it. No manual `pip install` lists allowed in Dockerfiles.
- **Pros**: Explicit, declarative. Clean caching.
- **Cons**: Can lead to version drift if not managed by a central lockfile or policy.

### Dependency Locking Tools: pip-compile and uv

To achieve deterministic builds, we use tools like `pip-compile` (from `pip-tools`) or `uv` to manage the translation between intent (`.in`) and lock (`.txt`).

1.  **Purpose**:
    *   `pip-compile` reads high-level dependency intent from `.in` files (e.g., `fastapi`, `pydantic`).
    *   It resolves the entire dependency graph and generates a locked `requirements.txt` containing exact versions (e.g., `fastapi==0.109.0`, `starlette==0.36.3`) and hashes.
    *   It **does not install** packages; it strictly generates the artifact.

2.  **Why this matters for Sanctuary**:
    *   **Determinism**: Ensures that Docker containers, local `.venv`s, and CI pipelines install mathematically identical environments.
    *   **Prevention**: Eliminates the class of bugs where a transitive dependency updates silently and breaks a service ("works on my machine" but fails in prod).
    *   **Alignment**: Supports the core principle that "every service defines one runtime world."

3.  **Workflow Example**:
    ```bash
    # Generate locked requirements (Do this when dependencies change)
    pip-compile requirements-core.in --output-file requirements-core.txt
    pip-compile requirements-dev.in --output-file requirements-dev.txt
    pip-compile mcp_servers/gateway/clusters/sanctuary_cortex/requirements.in \
      --output-file mcp_servers/gateway/clusters/sanctuary_cortex/requirements.txt
    
    # Install (Do this to run)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Local Environment Synchronization

ADR 073 mandates that **Core Principle #2 ("Execution environment does not change dependency logic")** applies strictly to local `.venv` and terminal execution. Pure Docker consistency is insufficient.

1.  **Policy**:
    *   Docker, Podman, and Local `.venv` must instal from the exact same locked artifacts.
    *   Local environments MAY additionally install `requirements-dev.txt` (which containers MUST skip).

2.  **Setup Strategies**:

    *   **Option A: Single Service Mode** (Focus on one component):
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        # Install runtime
        pip install -r mcp_servers/gateway/clusters/sanctuary_cortex/requirements.txt
        # Install dev tooling
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
        ```

    *   **Option B: Full Monorepo Mode** (Shared venv):
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        # Install shared baseline
        pip install -r mcp_servers/requirements-core.txt
        # Install all service extras (potentially conflicting, use with care)
        pip install -r mcp_servers/gateway/clusters/*/requirements.txt
        # Install dev tooling
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
        ```

3.  **Automation & Enforcement**:
    *   We will introduce a Makefile target `install-env` to standardize this.
    *   Agents must detect drift between `pip freeze` and locked requirements in active environments.

## Reference Directory Structure (Example)

```
mcp_servers/
  gateway/
    requirements-core.txt  <-- Shared Baseline

  filesystem/
    requirements.txt       <-- Service specific (installs core + extras)
    Dockerfile

  utils/
    requirements.txt

  cortex/
    requirements.txt
    Dockerfile

requirements-dev.txt       <-- Local Dev only
```

## Decision & Recommendations

We recommend **Option D** (Strict Mapping) enhanced with a **Tiered Policy**:

1.  **Eliminate Manual `pip install`**: All Dockerfiles must `COPY requirements.txt` and `RUN pip install -r`. No inline package lists.
2.  **Harmonize Versions**: We will create a `requirements-core.txt` at the `mcp_servers/gateway` level to define the **shared baseline**.
    *   Individual services MAY reference it (`-r requirements-core.txt`) or copy it explicitly.
    *   The mechanism is less important than the rule: Shared versions are centralized, runtime ownership remains local.
3.  **Locking Requirement (Critical)**: All `requirements.txt` files MUST be generated artifacts from `.in` files using a single approved tool (e.g., `pip-tools` or `uv`).
    *   `.in` files represent **human-edited dependency intent**.
    *   `.txt` files are **machine-generated locks** to ensure reproducible builds.
    *   Manual editing of `.txt` files is prohibited.
4.  **Dev vs Runtime Separation**: explicit `requirements-dev.txt` for local/test dependencies. Containers must NEVER install dev dependencies.
    *   Avoids the "Superset" risk where local logic relies on tools missing in production.
5.  **CI Enforcement**: CI pipelines must fail if any Dockerfile contains inline `pip install` commands not referencing a requirements file.
6.  **Clean Up**: Remove the redundant manual `pip install` block from `sanctuary_cortex/Dockerfile` immediately.

## Consequences

- **Immediate**: `sanctuary_cortex/Dockerfile` becomes cleaner and builds slightly faster (no double install checks).
- **Long-term**: Dependency updates (e.g., bumping `fastapi`) can be done in one place for 80% of the fleet.
- **Why**: ".in files exist to make upgrades safe and reproducible, not to change how services are run."
- **Determinism**: Builds become reproducible across machines and time (via locking).
- **Safety**: "Works on my machine" bugs reduced by strict dev/runtime separation.
- **Risk**: Needs careful audit of `sanctuary_cortex/requirements.txt` to ensuring nothing from the manual list is missing before deletion.

## Developer / Agent Checklist (Future Reference)

**Purpose**: Ensure all environments (Docker, Podman, local .venv) remain consistent with locked requirements.

### Verify Locked Files
- [ ] **Confirm `.in` files exist** for core, dev, and each service.
- [ ] **Confirm `.txt` files were generated** via `pip-compile` (or `uv`) from `.in` files.
- [ ] **Check that Dockerfiles point to the correct `requirements.txt`.**

### Update / Install Dependencies
#### Local venv / Terminal:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir -r mcp_servers/requirements-core.txt
pip install --no-cache-dir -r mcp_servers/gateway/clusters/<service>/requirements.txt
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-dev.txt  # optional for dev/test
```

#### Containers:
- [ ] Ensure Dockerfiles use:
    ```dockerfile
    COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /tmp/requirements.txt
    ```
- [ ] **Dev dependencies must not be installed in containers.**

### Check for Drift
- [ ] Compare `pip freeze` in active environments vs locked `.txt` files.
- [ ] Warn if any packages or versions differ.

### Regenerate Locks When Updating Dependencies
1.  Update `.in` files with new intent.
2.  Run `pip-compile` to produce updated `.txt` files.
3.  Verify Dockerfiles and local environments still match.

### Automation
- [ ] Use `make install-env TARGET=<service>` to sync venv for a specific service.
- [ ] CI pipelines should enforce: no inline `pip install`, only locked files allowed.

### Pre-Commit / Pre-Build
- [ ] Confirm all `.txt` files are up-to-date.
- [ ] Ensure Dockerfiles reference correct files.
- [ ] Optional: run `make verify` to validate local and container environments.
