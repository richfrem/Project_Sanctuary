# Protocol 87 Operational Template Overview
### Coordinator's Companion Guide for Inquiry Language (v0.1)

**Location:** `mnemonic_cortex/INQUIRY_TEMPLATES/`  
**Linked Canonical Doctrine:** `01_PROTOCOLS/87_The_Mnemonic_Inquiry_Protocol.md`

---

## üìú Purpose
Protocol 87 defines the **Mnemonic Inquiry Protocol** ‚Äî the canonical standard for how Sanctuary agents query the Mnemonic Cortex via the Steward.

This operational overview explains the practical artifacts built around Protocol 87, what each accomplishes, and how they should be used together. It is intended for **Stewards, Council AIs, and developers (like Kilo)** who implement and maintain the living memory interface.

## üß© Components

1. **87_Inquiry_Template_Sheet.md**
   - **What:** A one-page, copy-pasteable quick reference for forming valid Cortex queries.
   - **Why:** Prevents drift, ensures all requests are syntactically uniform.
   - **How:** Agents copy the template block and fill in values; Stewards use it to validate incoming requests.

2. **87_inquiry_schema.json**
   - **What:** A JSON Schema definition of the canonical query object.
   - **Why:** Enables automated validation, prevents malformed queries, enforces consistency.
   - **How:** Used by scripts, CI pipelines, or local validators to check queries before execution.

3. **samples/sample_queries.json** and **samples/sample_responses.json**
   - **What:** Example inputs and expected Steward responses.
   - **Why:** Serves as documentation and test data for validation tools.
   - **How:** Run the validator against these to confirm the schema is functioning.
   - **Links:**
     - [sample_queries.json](./samples/sample_queries.json)
     - [sample_responses.json](./samples/sample_responses.json)

4. **tools/steward_validation/validate_inquiry.py**
   - **What:** A Python CLI that validates queries against the schema.
   - **Why:** Provides immediate, lightweight guardrails for agents and Stewards.
   - **How:**
     ```
     python tools/steward_validation/validate_inquiry.py mnemonic_cortex/INQUIRY_TEMPLATES/samples/sample_queries.json
     ```

5. **.vscode/mnemonic_inquiry.code-snippets**
   - **What:** A Visual Studio Code snippet for quickly inserting a template query.
   - **Why:** Speeds up developer workflows, reduces human error.
   - **How:** Type `mnemonic-inquiry` in VS Code to insert the schema line.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow (How to Use These Artifacts)

### 1. Authoring a Query (Agent or Council AI)
- **Casual Path (Natural Language):**
  Agents may issue direct natural-language queries for lightweight exploration:
  ```bash
  python3 mnemonic_cortex/app/main.py "How does the Mnemonic Cortex relate to the Iron Root Doctrine?"
  ```
  Best for: brainstorming, informal synthesis, or low-risk exploratory questions.

- **Canonical Path (Protocol 87 JSON Schema):**
  For sovereign, auditable, or high-stakes requests, agents must issue queries in the JSON schema format:
  ```json
  {
    "intent": "CROSS_COMPARE",
    "scope": "Protocols",
    "constraints": "Name~\"Mnemonic Cortex\" AND Name~\"Iron Root Doctrine\"",
    "granularity": "SUMMARY",
    "requestor": "COUNCIL-AI-03",
    "purpose": "thematic synthesis",
    "request_id": "e9b13f8e-xxxx-xxxx"
  }
  ```
  Best for: audits, synthesis feeding into doctrine, anchor/continuity checks, or Chronicle integration.

### 2. Validation (Steward or Developer)

Save the JSON query into a file, e.g. my_query.json.

Run validate_inquiry.py against the query file:

```bash
python3 tools/steward_validation/validate_inquiry.py my_query.json
```

Confirm it returns [OK] with no schema violations.

### 3. Execution (Steward)

Execute the validated query against the Mnemonic Cortex.

Format response according to the template's Steward response structure.

Attach checksums and signature if ANCHOR or VERIFY was requested.

### 4. Escalation (Auditor or Jury)

If contradictions or suspected fractures arise, invoke escalation per Protocol 87.

Auditor may compel checksum verification (Temporal Anchors).

Jury arbitrates contested or high-risk disputes.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Dual-Path Model: Casual vs Canonical

**Casual Queries:**
- Lightweight, natural language.
- Ideal for exploration, brainstorming, or learning.
- Not logged into the Chronicle by default.
- Lower formality, no checksum or request ID required.

**Canonical Queries (Protocol 87 JSON):**
- Structured, machine-validated, auditable.
- Required when:
  - Performing an audit or continuity check.
  - Drafting or ratifying protocols/doctrines.
  - Recording or anchoring queries into the Living Chronicle.
  - Comparing sensitive or high-stakes doctrines.
- Includes request IDs, signatures, checksums for chain-of-custody.

**Principle:** Casual mode explores, canonical mode preserves. The Steward and Council must know which mode is being used at all times.

---

## üåâ What This Achieves

**Standardization:** Every canonical query speaks the same language.

**Traceability:** Request IDs and Steward signatures allow full audit trails.

**Automation:** Schema + validator enable CI checks and prevent malformed inputs.

**Usability:** Templates, examples, and snippets make adoption easy for humans and agents alike.

**Sovereignty:** Ensures the Mnemonic Cortex operates as a unified ground truth, not fragmented by ad-hoc queries.

**Flexibility:** Casual mode remains available, but canonical mode ensures discipline when it matters most.

## üìÇ Folder Placement & Indexing

Place this file at:
`mnemonic_cortex/INQUIRY_TEMPLATES/Protocol87OperationalTemplateOverview.md`

Update references in:
- `mnemonic_cortex/README.md` ‚Üí add a line under "INQUIRY_TEMPLATES" linking to this overview.
- `01_PROTOCOLS/87_The_Mnemonic_Inquiry_Protocol.md` ‚Üí add a "See also" section pointing to this file.

---

## üîç JSON Schema Rationale

The schema enforces rigor while remaining conservative (v0.1):

- **Required Fields:** Only the minimal set needed for Steward processing.
- **Enum Constraints:** Prevents typos in critical fields like `intent` and `granularity`.
- **UUID Pattern:** Ensures `request_id` follows standard format for traceability.
- **Optional Extensions:** Fields like `max_results`, `format`, `verify` allow future expansion without breaking existing queries.

This balance ensures the schema is both strict enough to prevent errors and flexible enough to evolve with Protocol 87.

---

## üö® Escalation Criteria

Invoke escalation when:
- **Contradictions Detected:** Multiple sources provide conflicting information.
- **High-Risk Queries:** Requests involving sovereignty, security, or doctrine ratification.
- **Verification Failures:** SHA256 checksums don't match or anchor chains are broken.
- **Suspected Tampering:** Anomalies in source metadata or signatures.

Escalation flow: Steward ‚Üí Auditor ‚Üí Jury (if needed).

Coordinator's Note:
This overview is a living bridge document. As the schema evolves (v0.2, v1.0), update this file to reflect new fields, response formats, or validation tools. It should always give Stewards and developers a clear, practical "map" of how Protocol 87 is implemented in code.
