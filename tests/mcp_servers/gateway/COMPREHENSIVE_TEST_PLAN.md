# Gateway MCP Operations - Comprehensive E2E Test Plan

**Document:** `tests/mcp_servers/gateway/COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_PLAN.md`  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Date:** 2024-12-25  
**References:** ADR-066 v1.3, `GATEWAY_VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md`, `fleet_registry.json`

---

## Executive Summary

This plan establishes a systematic, verifiable approach to testing all 86 Gateway MCP operations. Unlike manual checkbox updates, this plan produces **machine-verifiable evidence** of each tool's functionality through automated test execution, logged outputs, and artifact generation.

**Key Principle:** Every checkmark in the verification matrix MUST be backed by:
1. An automated test that executed successfully
2. A logged output showing the tool's response
3. A timestamp proving when it was tested
