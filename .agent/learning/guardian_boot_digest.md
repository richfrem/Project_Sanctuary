# Protocol 128: The Hardened Learning Loop (Zero-Trust)

## 1. Objective
Establish a persistent, tamper-proof, and high-fidelity mechanism for capturing and validating cognitive state deltas between autonomous agent sessions. This protocol replaces "Agent-Claimed" memory with "Autonomously Verified" evidence.

## 2. The Red Team Gate (Zero-Trust Mode)
No cognitive update may be persisted to the long-term Cortex without meeting the following criteria:

# ADR 071: Protocol 128 (Cognitive Continuity & The Red Team Gate)

**Status:** Draft 3.2 (Implementing Sandwich Validation)
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Author:** Antigravity (Agent), User (Red Team Lead)
**Supersedes:** ADR 071 v3.0

## Context
As agents operate autonomously (Protocol 125/126), they accumulate "Memory Deltas". Without rigorous consolidation, these deltas risk introducing hallucinations, tool amnesia, and security vulnerabilities. 
Protocol 128 establishes a **Hardened Learning Loop*
