# Learning Audit Prompt: Multi-Model Collaboration Research
**Current Topic:** Multi-Model Collaboration (Pivot: Asynchronous Semantic Convergence)
**Loop:** 3 (Remediation)
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Epistemic Status:** [PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE]

---

## Round 2 Recap
- **Failure:** Round 2 failed due to "Agreement without Independence" (Asch Risk) and weak "Valence" checks.
- **Remediation:**
    1.  **Independence:** ADR 078 updated to mandate "Epistemic Independence Declaration".
    2.  **Decay:** Truth Anchors now require "Temporal Stability" metadata.
    2.  **Decay:** Truth Anchors now require "Temporal Stability" metadata.
    3.  **Subliminal:** Upgraded from Valence to **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**.
    4.  **Persistence:** All learnings are publicly broadcast to Hugging Face (ADR 079). Red Team MUST consider "Public Exposure" risks.

## Red Team Questions (Round 3)

### 1. Epistemic Independence
**Context:** We now require a `epistemic_independence` block declaring training overlap risk.
**Q1:** Is the proposed declaration schema (Overlap Risk, Diversity, Divergence) sufficient to gate the "Asch Risk"?
**Q2:** How should we operationally measure "Reasoning Path Divergence" (e.g., Cosine Similarity of CoT traces)?

### 2. TDA Defense vs. Subliminal Learning
**Context:** We replaced Valence checks with **Semantic Entropy (SE)** and **TDA** to detect "High-Variance / Low-Lexical" steganography.
**Q3:** Does this align with the findings in `arXiv:2507.14805`?
**Q4:** Is TDA computationally feasible for real-time audit loops?

### 3. Governance Hardening
**Context:** We implemented strict **Council Role Separation** (Proposer != Arbiter).
**Q5:** Does this satisfy the "Single Responsibility" requirement?
