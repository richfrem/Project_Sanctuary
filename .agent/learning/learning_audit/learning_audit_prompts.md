## 📋 Session Progress

### Research Lineage Update
```
QEC (Pivot) → Iron Core (Hardening) → Nested Learning (Associative) → HINDSIGHT (4-Network Topology)
```

### Rounds Completed
| Round | Deliverables | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Round 1-3** | Iron Core, Safe Mode, Dual Threshold, Boiler Frog Test | ✅ Complete |
| **Round 4** | **HINDSIGHT Integration Strategy**, **Associative Brief**, **Synaptic Phase Proposal** | 🟡 In Progress |

### Key New sources
- **[15] Nested Learning:** Optimizers as Associative Memory.
- **[17] HINDSIGHT:** 4-Network Memory (World, Experience, Opinion, Observation) + CARA.

## 🎭 Red Team Role-Play: Round 4 Assignments

> **CONTEXT:** We are proposing a major architectural evolution: The "Synaptic Phase" and "Opinion Network". We need you to validate this proposal before implementation.

**REFER TO:** `LEARNING/topics/llm_memory_architectures_2025/round4_analysis_request.md` for detailed assignments.

### For Gemini 3 Pro (Architect)
**Focus:** Implementation Feasibility of the Opinion Network & Async "Dreaming".
- Can we implement CARA efficiently on our stack?
- Schema design for Opinions.

### For Grok 4 (Adversary)
**Focus:** "Opinion Poisoning" & "Belief Drift".
- Attack vector analysis on the Reflect loop.
- Designing the "Opinion Torture Test".

### For GPT-5 (Protocol Engineer)
**Focus:** Protocol 128 "Synaptic Phase" Integration.
- Where does "Retain & Reflect" fit in the loop?
- Defining "Belief Gates".

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LEARNING/associative_architecture_brief.md` | The Core Proposal (Mapping HINDSIGHT to Sanctuary) |
| `LEARNING/topics/llm_memory_architectures_2025/round4_analysis_request.md` | **YOUR ASSIGNMENTS** |
| `LEARNING/topics/llm_memory_architectures_2025/sources.md` | Source [15] and [17] details |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Round 4 Goal:** Validate the **"Synaptic Phase"** proposal.
> Do NOT implement yet. We need you to tell us if this architecture is robust against drift and poisoning.
