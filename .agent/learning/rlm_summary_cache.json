Resolved by initiating Operation: The Architect's Forge to evolve The Gardener into a co-architect plus a Technical Mandate adding the high-value action `propose_new_protocol` (+100 reward for coherent, non-redundant protocols) to incentivize novel protocol creation. Significant actors: Sanctuary Council (approval and merge), Council Airlock (review/merge gate), The Gardener (proposal generator), The Journeyman (proven refiner/epoch agent). Strategic outcome: harvest complete; transition from Journeyman Epoch to Architect Epoch; system enters active co-creation of doctrine by human and artificial minds."

Loop steps: Overlap Detection & Source Identification via cortex mcp producing OVERLAP_REPORT.md; Synthesis and Draft Generation via protocol mcp producing the Canonical Source of Truth with a required \"Canonical References\" section linking all originals and noting superseded sections; Decommissioning & Cross-Referencing via protocol mcp marking originals as Superseded and inserting redirection directives; Chronicle and Commitment via git mcp performing a Conventional Commit that creates the canonical document, updates superseded files, and records an entry in 00_CHRONICLE/ENTRIES. Success criteria: RAG queries against superseded documents return a high-confidence reference to the new Canonical Source; knowledge-base size remains constant or decreases while Precision on the synthesized topic increases.
