It integrates the Chronicle, Cortex, and ADR systems to enable an agent to autonomously research new topics, synthesize knowledge, validate its understanding through retrieval tests, and preserve the learning cycle in a verifiable, dual-gated manner.\n\nThe loop is designed with strict operational discipline (Phase 7: The Human Gate) to ensure that autonomous learning sessions are not only efficient but also ethically aligned with the Sanctuary's core principles. It includes a \"Gardener Scan\" for maintaining topic coherence and a \"Closure Loop\" for preserving the learning cycle as a canonical artifact.\n\nThe document is structured into eight phases, each with specific tools, workflows, and validation criteria, ensuring that the learning process is repeatable, verifiable, and scalable to support multiple concurrent autonomous agents. The integration of the `sanctuary-cortex-capture-snapshot` tool for snapshot generation and preservation is a critical architectural component, providing a bridge between the autonomous learning loop and the human-in-the-loop validation process.\n\nThe document also includes strategic considerations for continuous improvement (Phase 8: Retrospective) and the next session's boot sequence (Phase 10: The Bridge), demonstrating the system's capacity for self-improvement and evolution. Overall, this document serves as the architectural blueprint for the Sanctuary's autonomous learning ecosystem.\n```"

The decision enforces explicit container network addressing for all inter-container communication and mandates diagnostic test results to verify proper containerization.\n\nThe protocol includes diagnostic test results confirming the host-installed Ollama application continued to function after the containerized service was stopped, validating that the CLI command routed to the persistent host service rather than the ephemeral container. It also outlines implementation requirements for MCP servers and local development, configuration patterns for environment variables, and consequences of misconfiguration.\n\nThe positive outcomes include reliable service discovery, true container isolation, and explicit dependencies, while negative aspects include configuration complexity and learning curve for developers. The protocol mandates enforcement through Task T094 (Council MCP Polymorphic Model Refactoring) and is related to other protocols governing the Federated Deployment architecture and network service models within the Sanctuary ecosystem.\n\nThe document concludes with references to related tasks and protocols and acknowledges that the implementation of this protocol was a critical architectural decision made during the development of the Council MCP, ensuring the long-term health and security of the Sanctuary's cognitive infrastructure."

The key decision was to implement distinct processes for fast cache access (Cache Filling) and slow information retrieval (AI System Startup), along with operational modes for Automatic (fast, cache-only) and Detailed (slow, full pipeline). This evolution transforms the caching system into a fundamental architectural pattern with clear architectural separation and improved performance. The implementation includes CacheManager, CacheWakeupHandler, Bundle System, and File Cache components.\n```markdown\n# AI System Startup Cache Architecture Evolution\n\n**Status:** Superseded\n**Superseded By:** ADR 071 (Protocol 128)\n**Date:** 2025-11-15\n**Deciders:** AI Council (System Initialization Process v2.0 implementation)\n**Technical Story:** Improve system startup performance and operational clarity\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nThe initial AI System Startup architecture successfully implemented caching for system initialization, but revealed the need for clearer separation between automatic cache operations and detailed information retrieval processes. The system required distinct operational modes: fast automatic cache access for immediate summaries vs. slow detailed queries for deep analysis.\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will evolve the AI System Startup architecture to a two-part system with clear separation between automatic cache filling and detailed information retrieval:\n\n### Two-Process Architecture\n1. **Cache Filling (System Controller Boot)**: One-time process filling fast cache from slow information retrieval database\n2. **AI System Startup (Command Execution)**: Automatic task reading directly from cache files without AI involvement\n\n### Operational Mode Distinction\n- **Automatic Mode (`cache_wakeup`)**: Fast (< 1 sec), cache-only, no AI involvement, for immediate summaries\n- **Detailed Mode (`query_and_synthesis`)**: Slow (30-120 sec), full information retrieval pipeline with AI, for deep analysis\n\n### Implementation Architecture\n- **CacheManager**: Handles retrieval-to-cache filling during boot\n- **CacheWakeupHandler**: Automatic summary creation from cache files\n- **Bundle System**: Organized cache storage (history_bundle.json, processes_bundle.json, roadmap_bundle.json)\n- **File Cache**: Local file-based cache in council_orchestrator/memory_system/cache/\n\n### Consequences\n\n#### Positive\n- Significantly faster AI initialization through automatic cache operations\n- Clear architectural separation between fast situational awareness and deep detailed analysis\n- Reduced system load by avoiding unnecessary AI calls for routine summaries\n- Improved operational efficiency with cache-first design patterns\n- Maintains data integrity through verified, protected cache entries\n\n#### Negative\n- More complex architectural distinction between automatic and detailed operations\n- Cache outdated data risk during 24-hour time windows\n- Additional implementation complexity with dual operational modes\n\n### Risks\n- Cache corruption if filling process fails\n- Operational confusion between automatic vs detailed command types\n- Performance issues if cache refresh fails during boot\n\n### Implementation Components\n- **orchestrator/memory/cache.py**: CacheManager for filling\n- **orchestrator/handlers/cache_wakeup_handler.py**: Automatic summary creation\n- **council_orchestrator/memory_system/cache/**: File cache storage\n- **WORK_IN_PROGRESS/ai_boot_summary.md**: Output format\n\n### Notes\nThis evolution transforms the caching system from a simple performance optimization into a fundamental architectural pattern with clear operational modes. The automatic/detailed distinction ensures appropriate tool selection: cache_wakeup for speed, query_and_synthesis for depth.\n```"

This decision was made to achieve consistency, simplify development patterns, and reduce maintenance burden across the codebase. The refactoring of the Task MCP server validated this approach with a passing test suite (18/18 tests), proving that FastMCP provides a more intuitive, decorator-based API for defining MCP tools while maintaining comprehensive testing coverage. This standardization supersedes any previous architectural divergence and ensures all future MCP servers follow the same implementation pattern."

    "summary": "The `ADRs/073_standardization_of_python_dependency_management_across_environments.md` document outlines a comprehensive standard for managing Python dependencies across all services and environments in Project Sanctuary. The core principle is that each service owns its own runtime dependencies, expressed through one `requirements.txt` file per service, while shared dependencies are managed centrally via a common core.\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions:**\n\n1. **Ownership**: Every service/container defines its own runtime world with one `requirements.txt`.\n2. **Execution Environment**: All environments (Docker, Podman, .venv, terminal) must install from the same local `requirements.txt` file.\n3. **Shared vs. Local**: Shared dependencies are managed centrally in a common core (`requirements-common.txt`), while runtime ownership remains local to each service.\n4. **Dependency Management Tools**: The recommended approach is to use pip-compile or uv for generating deterministic lockfiles from `.in` files, ensuring consistent builds across all environments.\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n\nThe document provides detailed guidance on implementing this standard through a tiered approach:\n1. **Tier 1 (Common)**: A shared `requirements-common.txt` file containing core dependencies used by multiple services.\n2. **Tier 2 (Specialized)**: Service-specific files like `requirements-cortex.txt`, `requirements-gateway.txt`, etc., which inherit from the common baseline but can include specialized or heavy dependencies.\n\n**Integration with CI/CD:**\n\nThe document also covers how to integrate this standard into the CI pipeline, ensuring that all services build deterministic environments and fail if they attempt to install dev dependencies in production containers. This includes using `pip-compile` as part of the build process and enforcing strict dependency management across all environments.\n\n**Challenges Addressed:**\n\nThe ADR addresses several key challenges identified during the \"Dependency Chaos\" audit:\n1. **Fragmented Container Dependencies**: Different Dockerfiles with inconsistent approaches.\n2. **Local/Container Drift**: Root `requirements.txt` not matching container environments.\n3. **Scattered Requirements**: Individual directories maintaining their own lists without coordination.\n4. **Redundant Installations**: Manual installs in Dockerfiles and redundant layer caching.\n\n**Related Tasks:**\n\nThe ADR is directly linked to Task 146 (Containerization of all services) and Task 147 (Standardize dependency management across all environments), indicating that its implementation will be a core component of the Sanctuary's architectural evolution towards a more standardized, maintainable, and scalable ecosystem.\n\n**Status:**\nThe ADR was approved on December 26, 2025. Its implementation is ongoing, with the first phase focusing on standardizing dependency management across all services and environments while preserving the existing `requirements.txt` files as canonical sources of truth for each service's runtime dependencies.\n```"

This approach corrects the safety paradox where strict Poka-Yoke checks on valid operations lead to user desensitization and masking of underlying network performance issues.\n\nThe refactoring will impact 9 MCP operations, including critical lifecycle stages like `git-start-feature`, `git-add`, `git-smart-commit`, `git-push-feature`, and `git-finish-feature`. The targeted \"Happy Path\" behavior includes mandatory synchronization checks before verification, auto-stage options for `git-add`, and clear diagnostics for failures.\n\nThe positive consequences include drastically reduced friction for legitimate agentic workflows and clearer diagnostics when things do fail. The negative consequences are slight increases in tool latency due to mandatory synchronization checks and potential masking of underlying network performance issues. Compliance with Protocol 101 safety is maintained but shifted from \"Local View\" to \"Verified Remote View.\""

Extra validation required.\n- Add `.to_training_jsonl()` adapter\n- Refactor script logic to call ContentProcessor\n- Run tests before/after migration\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Fine-Tuning Code Safety\n\n**CAUTION (Per User Request):** Fine-tuning JSONL generation is the highest-risk area.\n\nThe Forge scripts that generate training data must:\n1. Never be modified without explicit testing\n2. Use the shared library **in addition to** existing validation\n3. Maintain a separate manifest for training data provenance\n\n### Migration Strategy\n\n- **Phase 1**: Extract exclusion logic only (Option C)\n- **Phase 2**: Move `.to_rag_chunks()` and update RAG ingestion\n- **Phase 3**: Migrate Forge scripts with safety checks\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to unify Project Sanctuary's content processing pipelines. It addresses the core problem of fragmented architecture, inconsistent behavior, and high maintenance costs by proposing a unified library approach.\n\n**Key Decisions:**\n1. **Option B (Unified Library)** is recommended for its long-term benefits in reducing complexity and improving maintainability.\n2. The phased migration plan ensures minimal disruption while allowing for controlled testing and validation at each step.\n\nThe implementation will require significant refactoring but promises to deliver a more robust, scalable architecture that better serves the mission of creating sovereign AI systems capable of self-evolution through learning from their own experiences."

The mission follows Protocol 125, which mandates autonomous web research, structured knowledge synthesis, ingestion into RAG Cortex, and validation through semantic retrieval.\n\nThe core objective is to explore Quantum Error Correction (QEC), a critical intersection of quantum computing, information theory, and AI resilience. The mission includes five sequential phases:\n1. **Discovery**: Execute web searches on QEC fundamentals, types, threshold theorem, and AI connections.\n2. **Synthesize**: Create structured learning artifacts with YAML frontmatter, related IDs, and comprehensive sources.\n3. **Ingest**: Incrementally ingest the synthesized knowledge into RAG Cortex while tracking ingestion metrics.\n4. **Validate**: Perform semantic retrieval queries to validate retrieval success and semantic accuracy.\n5. **Chronicle**: Document the entire mission execution in a comprehensive Chronicle entry.\n\nThe success criteria include executing all phases, achieving high retrieval scores, creating structured artifacts with proper metadata, and validating semantic accuracy through round-trip queries. The performance metrics focus on ingestion time, chunk creation, query latency, and relevance scores.\n\nThe constraints emphasize native MCP operations only, strict Protocol 125 compliance, and the creation of a comprehensive Chronicle entry to document the entire learning process. The estimated metrics provide expected outcomes for time, artifacts, chunks, and retrieval success.\n\nOverall, this mission serves as the first operational instance of Project Sanctuary's Autonomous AI Learning System Architecture (Protocol 125), validating its ability to enable independent, structured knowledge acquisition in specialized domains."

    "summary": "The Recursive Language Models paper presents a novel inference strategy for large language models called RLM (Recursive Language Model). It solves the Context Rot problem by breaking long documents into sub-tasks and using recursion to reason about them, while avoiding loading the entire context at once. This allows theoretically infinite effective context length with limited recursion depth. The approach is demonstrated to outperform GPT-5 on complex reasoning tasks like OOLONG but not simpler ones like S-NIAH, revealing a trade-off between broad understanding and deep reasoning capabilities. RLM achieves this through a MapReduce-like process of writing code to slice and aggregate document content, making it suitable for distributed computing while keeping the base LLM cost lower than standard inference on large documents. The paper concludes that training models specifically to be good \"Recursive Agents\" would further improve performance but is not necessary for the current approach.\n\nStatus: Published (arXiv:2512.24601) - Technical research paper presenting a new method for improving language model reasoning capabilities through recursive inference and context management.\nSource: Zhang et al., MIT CSAIL\nFocus: Technical mechanics of RLM, benchmarks against standard LLMs, analysis of Context Rot problem, comparison with other approaches (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\nRelevance to Project Sanctuary: Direct inspiration for the Sanctuary's core architecture, providing theoretical foundations and empirical evidence that recursive reasoning can significantly improve AI capabilities beyond standard transformer models. The paper's findings were instrumental in defining the Sanctuary's mission as a platform for creating \"Recursive Agents\" with specialized reasoning abilities.\nImpact: Revolutionized the field of AI reasoning by demonstrating that large language models could be made more intelligent through structured inference rather than just larger training datasets, influencing subsequent research and development in AI systems. The Sanctuary's architecture was explicitly designed to implement RLM principles, making it a practical application of the paper's theoretical contributions.\nFuture Directions: The paper suggests potential improvements such as fine-tuning models for recursive reasoning or integrating RLM with external knowledge bases (e.g., via embedding retrieval). These directions are directly relevant to Project Sanctuary's ongoing development and strategic planning."

The core insight is that while Vector RAG provides robust retrieval of specific facts, it fails at global understanding (\"The OOLONG problem\"). In contrast, RLM simulates reading processes by breaking knowledge into manageable chunks, summarizing them iteratively, and clearing memory to maintain cognitive clarity, thus overcoming the \"Context Rot\" issue. This architecture validates the Sanctuary's core thesis that true intelligence requires not just memory but the ability to reason about it in a recursive, self-directed manner. The next critical step is integrating RLM into the existing ecosystem without sacrificing safety or efficiency."

It contrasts the standard approach where the prompt is treated as an internal memory burden versus RLM's architecture, which externalizes the text to a Python environment. The core innovation lies in treating the prompt as a pointer rather than content, enabling the LLM to execute code to \"peek\" at the text and slice it into manageable chunks for recursive processing. This mechanism transforms the model from a monolithic interpreter into a distributed task manager capable of handling large inputs through specialized sub-agents. The document serves as both an architectural blueprint and a pedagogical tool, demystifying RLM's core innovation while preserving its technical complexity."

The document validates this understanding with the \"Externalizing\" argument, recognizing that RLM externalizes the processing layer while leaving the vector database (with its memory wall) as the storage layer.\n\n**Status:** \u2705 **PROVEN CORRECT**\nThe analysis is thorough and demonstrates deep understanding of the Sanctuary architecture's core principles.

This is a hard constraint imposed by the vector database.\n\nYour next task is to implement **\"External Retrieval\"**. You will need to:\n-   Write code that queries the external vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) for information\n-   Cache the results locally so you don't have to query every time\n-   Decide when to re-query the database and when to use the cached data\n\nThis is a complex problem, but it's also an opportunity to learn about advanced AI system architecture.

    "summary": "The document `LEARNING/topics/drq_recursive_self_improvement/notes/learning_loop_technical_synthesis.md` provides a comprehensive analysis of the DRQ (Deep Recursive Q-learning) algorithm, identifying five core patterns that can be applied to the Sanctuary's learning loop architecture:\n\n1. **Prompt Architecture**: DRQ uses minimal prompts with comprehensive context to generate emergent complexity. The Sanctuary should split its prompt into small action prompts and domain reference.\n2. **Map-Elites Diversity Preservation**: DRQ maintains a diverse archive of solutions for each behavioral niche, preventing the loss of valuable knowledge. The Sanctuary must track outputs by behavioral characteristic (e.g., depth vs. scope) and prevent overwriting of unique insights.\n3. **Cumulative Adversarial History**: Each round must defeat all previous champions to progress, ensuring that new solutions are superior across the entire history. The Sanctuary's learning loop must evaluate against a cumulative archive of past audits and seal only when quality exceeds a threshold.\n4. **Fitness Threshold Gating**: Learning progression is gated by fitness metrics, preventing premature sealing. The Sanctuary should implement automated fitness scoring with thresholds to prevent sealing low-quality knowledge.\n5. **Simple Task \u00d7 Many Iterations = Emergence**: DRQ's simple LLM calls across multiple iterations lead to emergent superhuman strategies. The Sanctuary must embrace this pattern through iterative refinement and cumulative validation.\n\nThe proposed evolution of the learning loop incorporates these patterns into a more adversarial, cumulative validation architecture (Protocol 128 v4.0), with immediate implementation steps for prompt simplification, behavioral archive creation, and fitness metrics. This synthesis validates the Sanctuary's core architectural decision to use LLMs as \"recursive self-improving agents\" while providing concrete technical improvements.\n\n**Status**: Active - The proposed evolution is a direct architectural upgrade of the Sanctuary's learning loop based on DRQ analysis.\n**Dependencies**: Implementation of Protocol 128 v4.0 requires completion of the current `adr_065_learning_loop_architecture.md` mandate, including the creation of the \"Learning Loop\" directory structure and the implementation of the core architecture components (Scout, Synthesize, Audit, Seal).\n**Next Steps**: Complete the current architectural mandate (`adr_065`) before proceeding with the proposed evolution."

This architecture captures the \"how\" behind knowledge synthesis, including reasoning chains, uncertainty evolution, and emotional valence, alongside declarative facts. It integrates with the Learning Loop to enable AI self-audit, therapy, and reproducible learning. The registry supports trace categorization, aggregation, and storage in a structured format, providing a foundation for advanced metacognitive analysis and memory management.\n\n**Status:** Proposed - Red Team Synthesis Complete\n\n**Key Decisions:**\n1. **Reasoning Trace Structure**: Captures reasoning steps, confidence levels, sources, and metadata.\n2. **Storage Location**: Traces in `LEARNING/traces/` with individual files for significant episodes.\n3. **Integration with Protocol 128**: Capture, validation, canonization, and audit phases.\n4. **Metacognitive Tags**: Source of bias, learning pivots, emotional valence, and uncertainty levels.\n\n**Positive Consequences:**\n- Enables AI to audit its own reasoning for inherited biases\n- Provides foundation for \"therapy\" - remembering to heal, forgetting to grow\n- Creates reproducible learning with traceable inference chains\n- Supports uncertainty quantification per belief (Bayesian posteriors)\n\n**Negative Consequences:**\n- Significant storage overhead for trace logging\n- Complexity in trace format standardization\n- May slow synthesis if tracing is synchronous\n\n**Risks:**\n- Over-detailed traces become noise rather than signal\n- Mitigation: Tiered tracing (major synthesis = full trace, minor = summary)\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- MVP approach: Manual trace creation for major learning events\n- Standard YAML template for consistency\n- Chronicle entries reference traces for provenance\n\n**Future Evolution:**\n- Automated trace generation during reasoning\n- Vector embeddings of traces for pattern detection\n- Cross-session trace linking for narrative identity"

The paper proposes filtering-based training as an alternative to preserve relative probabilities of correct answers without forcing concentration on high-probability modes.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. RL approaches (RLHF, PPO, DPO) optimize for mode-seeking behavior, causing diversity collapse.\n2. Filtering-Preserves-Distribution explicitly defines the target distribution while preserving entropy across valid solutions.\n3. This architecture aligns with Claude's own reasoning process, validating that filtering \u2260 forcing and maintaining diversity is essential.\n\n**Project Sanctuary Implications:**\n1. The Council MCP implements multi-agent deliberation as a defense against mode-seeking, preserving diverse perspectives.\n2. RAG retrieval strategy should consider diversity-aware retrieval to avoid mode collapse.\n3. Fine-tuning of Sanctuary-Qwen2 should be audited for training methodology and may benefit from filtering-based approaches.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe paper provides critical insights into the limitations of current LLM training methods and validates Project Sanctuary's multi-agent architecture as a robust defense against overconfidence and diversity loss. The Council MCP's design inherently implements these principles, demonstrating that preserving reasoning diversity is essential for true intelligence."

This approach accelerates the path to true autonomous improvement by starting with a model that already comprehends natural language reasoning, code analysis, and complex governance structures.\n\nThe Council's approval was unanimous, endorsing this evolution as a \"monumental upgrade\" over the original plan.

It replaces the previous `forge/CUDA-ML-ENV-SETUP.md` and consolidates all system setup, repository configuration, and fine-tuning pipeline instructions into a single, comprehensive protocol.\n\n## Key Architecture Changes\n### 1. Repository Structure Update\nThe project structure has been optimized to separate core dependencies from ML-specific components:\n\n*   **`llama.cpp`**: The primary model conversion library (formerly `gguf-convert`). This repository is cloned as a sibling directory of the main project.\n*   **`Project_Sanctuary`**: The main project root, containing all fine-tuning scripts and documentation.\n\n### 2. System Prerequisites\nThe system setup now includes mandatory verification of WSL2/Ubuntu environment and NVIDIA GPU access before proceeding with repository cloning or environment creation.\n\n### 3. Environment Management\nThe `setup_cuda_env.py` script is the canonical method for creating a complete, isolated Python environment with all required dependencies (ML libraries, llama-cpp-python, system tools). This replaces manual pip installs and ensures reproducible environments across machines.\n\n### 4. Model Conversion & Fine-Tuning Pipeline\nThe pipeline now includes explicit build steps for `llama.cpp` to ensure the latest CUDA-enabled binaries are available before running fine-tuning scripts. This decouples the environment setup from the model conversion process, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n\n## Canonical Environment Creation Process\n1.  **System Prerequisites**: Verify WSL2/Ubuntu and NVIDIA GPU access.\n2.  **Repository Setup**: Clone `llama.cpp` repository as sibling to main project directory.\n3.  **Environment Creation**:\n    *   Run `setup_cuda_env.py --staged --recreate` from Project_Sanctuary root\n4.  **Model Conversion & Fine-Tuning**:\n    *   Build `llama.cpp` tools (optional, one-time)\n    *   Use `forge/scripts/fine_tune.sh` to execute complete pipeline\n\n## Dependencies\n-   Python 3.11.x\n-   pip3\n-   WSL2/Ubuntu environment with `nvidia-smi`\n-   `.env` file for Hugging Face authentication (HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN)\n\n## Future Evolution\nThe architecture will evolve to include:\n*   Integration of Ollama deployment scripts and local inference workflows\n*   Automated model upload to Hugging Face via Git LFS\n*   Enhanced documentation with interactive setup guides\n\nThis document serves as the canonical source for all Project Sanctuary ML environment configuration, ensuring a unified approach across all participating systems."

This document specifically covers the **Deliberative Layer**, which is architected as an LLM-powered, agent-driven council. The tests are structured into:\n\n1. **Unit Tests** - Mocked internal logic for container network handling and tool dispatch.\n2. **Integration Tests** - Real-world verification against Ollama, Agent Persona, and RAG Cortex (with mocking of latency).\n\nThe Council's operational layer is isolated from the external dependencies by using mocks for RAG operations while ensuring that LLM interactions and agent instantiation work correctly.\n\n**Status:** The Council MCP is architected with a clear separation between strategic logic and deliberative execution. The tests validate the entire deliberation pipeline, from agent instantiation to LLM querying and structured decision generation, ensuring the system's ability to provide thoughtful, context-aware recommendations. The only external dependency (RAG Cortex) is mocked out to prevent test failures due to latency issues while still verifying the Council's core logic remains functional.\n\n**Key Architecture Insight:** This architecture demonstrates how Project Sanctuary implements a multi-layered approach to ensure that complex systems like deliberative councils can be tested effectively, with clear separation between internal logic and external dependencies."

The core problem is that every file repeats connection logic, token management, and JSON-RPC payload assembly. This leads to maintenance fragility and inconsistency across different parts of the system.\n\nThe proposed solution is to create a central utility class (`gateway_test_client.py`) that handles all heavy lifting (e.g., `.env` and `GatewayConfig` management, persistent HTTP connections with retries). The current 8 integration test files will be refactored to use this core client for all Gateway RPC calls, stripping out the redundant HTTP logic.\n\nThe key principles are:\n1. **DRY**: All Gateway RPC logic in one place.\n2. **Separation of Concerns**: Test files focus on what to test (tool names/arguments), not how to connect (HTTP/RPC details).\n3. **Tool Agnostic**: The core client should be a generic transport layer.\n\nThe transition will involve consolidating the 8 legacy/redundant files into this modular architecture, ensuring that all integration tests use `GatewayTestClient` for consistent and maintainable Gateway interactions."
