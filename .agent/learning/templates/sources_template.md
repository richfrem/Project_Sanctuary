## MANDATORY VERIFICATION RULES (DO NOT IGNORE)

1. **MUST VERIFY ALL LINKS:** You MUST use the `read_url_content` tool on EVERY link before adding it to this file.
2. **MUST NOT INCLUDE BROKEN LINKS:** If a link returns 404, finding a replacement is MANDATORY. Do not guess.
3. **MUST MATCH 100%:** Title, Authors, and Date must match the verified source EXACTLY. Credibility is lost with even one error.
4. **MUST FOLLOW TEMPLATE:** Do not deviate from this schema.
