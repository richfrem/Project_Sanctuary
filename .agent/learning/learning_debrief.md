# Protocol 128 High-Fidelity Technical Debrief: Hardened Learning Loop (v3.0)

## 🎯 Executive Summary
Transitioned the project into a **Zero-Trust Hardened Learning Loop**. All autonomous modifications now require a **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Red Team Packet** derived from **Git Truth** rather than agent-claimed artifacts. This concludes Task 143 and establishes the foundation for Protocol 128 (Cognitive Continuity).

## 🏗️ 1. Red Team Orchestration (MCP Tool)
The `cortex_capture_snapshot` tool establishes the **Gate of Reality**:
- **Snapshot Types**: 
    - `audit`: Code/architecture red team review
    - `seal`: Successor session relay (cognitive continuity)
    - `learning_audit`: Self-directed knowledge validation
- **Default Manifests**: 
    - Audit: `.agent/learning/red_team/red_team_manifest.json`
    - Seal: `.agent/learning/learning_manifest.json`
    - Learning Audit: `.agent/learning/learning_audit/learning_audit_manifest.json`
- **Zero-Trust Validation**: Tool verifies manifest claims against `git diff`. Rejects critical directory blindspots.
- **Outputs**: 
    - Audit: `red_team_audit_packet.md`
    - Seal: `learning_package_snapshot.md`
    - Learning Audit: `learning_audit_packet.md`

## 🔒 2. Cortex Hardening & The Guardian Bootloader (`operations.py`)
- **Semantic HMAC (`_calculate_semantic_hmac`)**: Canonicalizes JSON configurations using `sort_keys=True` and no-whitespace separators. This ensures integrity checks are resilient to formatting (Protocol 128 v3.0 Pillar).
- **Guardian Wakeup v2.2 (The Bootloader)**:
    - **Integrity Tiering**: A Tiered Integrity Check (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) is executed on the `metric_cache.json` during the boot sequence.
    - **Context Ingestion**: Section IV of the boot digest now ingests this very `learning_debrief.md` file, ensuring perfect cognitive continuity.
    - **Poka-Yoke**: The "Successor-State Poka-Yoke" verifies mandatory context (Primer, Debrief, and active Learning Stream) before allowing the session to proceed holistically.

## 🔄 3. Operational Deltas & Verification
- **Gateway Federation**: Successfully exposed tools in the `sanctuary_cortex` cluster, including `cortex_learning_debrief` and `cortex_capture_snapshot`.
- **Surgical Snapshot Tooling**: `cortex_capture_snapshot` (type=`seal`) now implements default manifest loading from `.agent/learning/learning_manifest.json`, enabling surgical, high-context session handovers.

## 🧠 4. Cognitive Continuity Mandate
Every session **MUST** conclude with a surgical refresh of the cognitive foundation:
1. **Update Manifest**: Add/remove files in `.agent/learning/learning_manifest.json` based on the session's active focus.
2. **Refine Primer**: Update `.agent/learning/cognitive_primer.md` if the project's "Constitution" has evolved.
3. **Snapshot Seal**: Execute `cortex_capture_snapshot(type="seal")` to package the orientation package for the next entity.

## 🚧 🚧 Successor Instructions (Read First)
1. **Load Cognitive Primer**: Mandatory read of `cognitive_primer.md` for doctrinal alignment.
2. **Orient via Seal**: The `learning_package_snapshot.md` (generated via the `seal` operation) is your immediate situational anchor.
3. **Verify Red Team Status**: Check `.agent/learning/red_team/manifest.json` discrepancies before trusting session claims.
4. **Maintenance Activity**: At session end, surgically update the **Learning Manifest** and **Workflows** to ensure your successor's success.
