  Python dependency and environment management for multi-service or monorepo python backends.
  Use when: (1) adding, upgrading, or removing a Python package, (2) responding to Dependabot
  or security vulnerability alerts (GHSA/CVE), (3) creating a new service that needs its
  own requirements files, (4) debugging pip install failures or Docker build issues related
  to dependencies, (5) reviewing or auditing the dependency tree, (6) running pip-compile.
  Enforces the pip-compile locked-file workflow and tiered dependency hierarchy.

# Dependency Management

## Core Rules

1. **Never `pip install <pkg>` directly.** All changes flow through `.in` → `pip-compile` → `.txt`.
2. **Always commit both `.in` and `.txt` together.** The `.in` is human intent; the `.txt` is the machine-verified lockfile.
3. **One runtime per service.** Each isolated service owns its own `requirements.txt` lockfile.

## Repository Layout (Example)

```
src/
├── requirements-core.in          # Tier 1: shared baseline (fastapi, pydantic…)
├── requirements-core.txt         # Lockfile for core
├── services/
│   ├── auth_service/
│   │   ├── requirements.in       # Tier 2: inherits core + auth deps
│   │   └── requirements.txt
│   ├── payments_service/
│   │   ├── requirements.in
│   │   └── requirements.txt
│   └── database_service/
│       ├── requirements.in
│       └── requirements.txt
```

## Tiered Hierarchy

| Tier | Scope | File | Examples |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| **1 – Core** | Shared by >80% of services | `requirements-core.in` | `fastapi`, `pydantic`, `httpx` |
| **2 – Specialized** | Service-specific heavyweights | `<service>/requirements.in` | `stripe`, `redis`, `asyncpg` |
| **3 – Dev tools** | Never in production containers | `requirements-dev.in` | `pytest`, `black`, `ruff` |

Each service `.in` file usually begins with `-r ../../requirements-core.in` to inherit the core dependencies.

## Workflow: Adding or Upgrading a Package

1. **Declare** — Add or update the version constraint in the correct `.in` file.
   - If the package is needed by most services → `requirements-core.in`
   - If only one service → that service's `.in`
   - Security floor pins use `>=` syntax: `cryptography>=46.0.5`

2. **Lock** — Compile the lockfile:
   ```bash
   # Core
   pip-compile src/requirements-core.in \
     --output-file src/requirements-core.txt

   # Individual service (example: auth)
   pip-compile src/services/auth_service/requirements.in \
     --output-file src/services/auth_service/requirements.txt
   ```
   Because services inherit core via `-r`, recompiling a service also picks up core changes.

3. **Sync** — Install locally to verify:
   ```bash
   pip install -r src/services/<service>/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify** — Rebuild the affected Docker/Podman container to confirm stable builds.

5. **Commit** — Stage and commit **both** `.in` and `.txt` files together.

## Workflow: Responding to Dependabot / Security Alerts

1. **Identify the affected package and fixed version** from the advisory (GHSA/CVE).

2. **Determine tier placement:**
   - Check if the package is a **direct** dependency (appears in an `.in` file).
   - If it only appears in `.txt` files, it's **transitive** — pinned by something upstream.

3. **For direct dependencies:** Bump the version floor in the relevant `.in` file.
   ```
   # SECURITY PATCHES (Mon YYYY)
   package-name>=X.Y.Z
   ```

4. **For transitive dependencies:** Add a version floor pin in the appropriate `.in` file
   to force the resolver to pull the patched version, even though it's not a direct dependency.

5. **Recompile all affected lockfiles.** Since services inherit core, a core change means
   recompiling every service lockfile. Use this compilation order:
   ```bash
   # 1. Core first
   pip-compile src/requirements-core.in \
     --output-file src/requirements-core.txt

   # 2. Then each service
   for svc in auth_service payments_service database_service; do
     pip-compile "src/services/${svc}/requirements.in" \
       --output-file "src/services/${svc}/requirements.txt"
   done
   ```

6. **Verify the patched version appears** in all affected `.txt` files:
   ```bash
   grep -i "package-name" src/requirements-core.txt \
     src/services/*/requirements.txt
   ```

7. **If no newer version exists** (e.g., inherent design risk like pickle deserialization),
   document the advisory acknowledgement as a comment in the `.in` file and note mitigations.

## Container / Dockerfile Constraints

- Dockerfiles **only** use `COPY requirements.txt` + `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- No `RUN pip install <pkg>` commands. No manual installs.
- Copy `requirements.txt` **before** source code to preserve Docker layer caching.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to recompile downstream services** after a core `.in` change.
- **Pinning `==` instead of `>=`** for security floors — use `>=` so `pip-compile` can resolve freely.
- **Adding dev tools to production `.in` files** — keep `pytest`, `ruff`, etc. in `requirements-dev.in`.
- **Committing `.txt` without `.in`** — always commit them as a pair.
