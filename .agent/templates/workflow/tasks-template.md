# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Naming Conventions
- **Task ID**: T001, T002... (Sequential)
- **Story Label**: [US1], [US2]... (Mandatory for story tasks)
- **Parallel**: [P] (Optional, indicates no dependencies)

  TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS
  
  1. Setup & Foundations: ALWAYS include Phase 1 & 2.

  3. Closure: ALWAYS include the Final Phase (Retrospective/Merge).
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight
- [ ] T000 Check for existing branch `spec/[NNN]-[name]`
- [ ] T001 If clean, create/checkout branch `spec/[NNN]-[name]`
- [ ] T002 Initialize Spec Bundle (`spec.md`, `plan.md`) via `/workflow-start`

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] T003 Initialize project/script structure
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure environment/dependencies

## Phase 2: Foundation (Blocking)
- [ ] T005 [Crucial step blocking all stories]

## Phase 3: User Story 1 (Priority: P1)
- [ ] T006 [US1] Implementation Step 1
- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Implementation Step 2

## Phase 4: User Story 2 (Priority: P2)
- [ ] T008 [US2] Implementation Step 1

## Phase N: Closure & Merge (MANDATORY)
- [ ] TXXX Run `/workflow-retrospective`
- [ ] TXXX Commit all changes to Feature Branch
- [ ] TXXX Push to remote and Create Pull Request
- [ ] TXXX Confirm with User: "PR Merged?"
- [ ] TXXX Run `/workflow-end`
