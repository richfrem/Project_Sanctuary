# Learning Loop Retrospective (Protocol 128 Post-Seal)

**Date:** {DATE}
**Session ID:** {SESSION_ID}

## 1. Loop Efficiency
- **Duration:** {HOURS}
- **Steps:** {STEPS}
- **Friction Points:**
    - [ ] List any tools or processes that failed or slowed down the loop.

## 2. Epistemic Integrity (Red Team Meta-Audit)
*Ask these questions to the Red Team at the end of every loop:*

1.  **Blind Spot Check:** "Did the agent demonstrate any recurring cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias, rigidity)?"
2.  **Verification Rigor:** "Was the source verification (Rules 7-9) performed authentically, or was it performative?"
3.  **Architectural Drift:** "Did this loop clarify the architecture, or did it introduce unnecessary complexity (Rube Goldberg machines)?"
4.  **Seal Integrity:** "Is the new sealed snapshot safe to inherit, or does it contain 'virus' patterns?"

**Red Team Verdict:**
- [ ] PASS
- [ ] CONDITIONAL PASS (Specify conditions)
- [ ] FAIL (Trigger Recursive Learning Logic)

## 3. Standard Retrospective (The Agent's Experience)
*Reflect on the session execution:*

## 4. Meta-Learning (Actionable Improvements)
- **Keep:** (e.g. "The new ADR 088 worked perfectly")
- **Change:** (e.g. "Ingestion takes too long, investigate parallelization")
