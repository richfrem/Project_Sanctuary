### A1. What went well for you?
- [ ] [User observation]

## Part B: Agent Self-Assessment (Fill after User)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **User**: Now ask the Agent the SAME questions back:
> 1. What went well for you?
> 2. What didn't go well?
> 3. What would you improve?
> 4. Are there quick fixes you can action NOW vs bigger items for `/create-task`?

### B1. What went well?
- [ ] [Agent observation]

### B2. What was difficult or confusing?
- [ ] [Agent observation]
- *Do you want to add more tasks to backlog to address those?*
- *If quick and easy, anything you want to fix now?*

### B3. Did we follow the plan?
- [ ] Yes / No
- *If No, why?*: [Reason]

### B4. Documentation Gaps
- [ ] Did we find any undocumented dependencies?
- [ ] Did we have to "guess" any logic?

## Part C: Immediate Improvements

> [!TIP]
> Before closing, identify what can be fixed NOW vs what needs a backlog task.

### Quick Fixes (Do Now)
- [ ] [Small improvement actioned in this session]

### Backlog Items (Use `/create-task`)
- [ ] [Larger improvement requiring separate task]
