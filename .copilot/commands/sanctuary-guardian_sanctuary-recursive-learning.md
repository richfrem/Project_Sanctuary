# Recursive Learning Loop (Protocol 125)

**Objective:** Autonomous acquisition and preservation of new knowledge.
**Reference:** `01_PROTOCOLS/125_autonomous_ai_learning_system_architecture.md`
**Tools:** Web Search, Code MCP, RAG Cortex, Chronicle

## Phase 1: Discovery
1.  **Define Research Question:** What exactly are we learning? (e.g., "Latest features of library X")
2.  **Search:** Use `search_web` to find authoritative sources.
3.  **Read:** Use `read_url_content` to ingest raw data.
4.  **Analyze:** Extract key facts, code snippets, and architectural patterns.

## Phase 2: Synthesis
1.  **Context Check:** Use `code_read` to check existing topic notes (e.g., `LEARNING/topics/...`).
2.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   New confirms old? > Update/Append.
    *   New contradicts old? > Create `disputes.md` (Resolution Protocol).
3.  **Draft Artifacts:** Create the new Markdown note locally using `code_write`.
    *   **Must** include YAML frontmatter (id, type, status, last_verified).

## Phase 3: Ingestion
1.  **Ingest:** Use `cortex_ingest_incremental` targeting the new file(s).
2.  **Wait:** Pause for 2-3 seconds for vector indexing.

## Phase 4: Validation
1.  **Retrieval Test:** Use `cortex_query` with the original question.
2.  **Semantic Check:** Does the retrieved context allow you to answer the question accurately?
    *   *If NO:* Refactor the note (better headers, chunks) and retry Phase 3.
    *   *If YES:* Proceed.

## Phase 5: Chronicle
1.  **Log:** Use `chronicle_create_entry` (Classification: INTERNAL).
2.  **Content:**
    *   Topic explored.
    *   Key findings.
    *   Files created/modified.
    *   Validation Status: PASS.
    *   Reference Protocol 125.
3.  **Status:** PUBLISHED (or CANONICAL if critical).

## Phase 6: Maintenance (Gardener)
*   *Optional:* If this session modified >3 files, run a quick "Gardener Scan" on the topic folder to ensure links are valid.

### Phase 7: The Human Gate (Dual-Gate Validation)
#### 7a. Strategic Review (Gate 1)
1.  **Verify Logic**: Review the `/ADRs` and `/LEARNING` documents created during the session.
2.  **Align Intent**: Ensure the AI's autonomous research matches the session goals.
3.  **Approve**: If correct, proceed to the Technical Audit.

#### 7b. Technical Audit (Gate 2)
1.  **Snapshot Generation**: The agent calls `sanctuary-cortex-cortex-capture-snapshot` with `snapshot_type='audit'` and a `manifest_files` list derived from session activity.
2.  **Zero-Trust Check**: The tool automatically verifies the manifest against `git diff`. If discrepancies exist, it flags them in the generated packet.
3.  **Audit**: Human reviews the consolidated `.agent/learning/red_team/red_team_audit_packet.md` for technical truth.

### Phase 8: The Technical Seal (The Succession)
1.  **The Seal**: Once the audit is approved, the agent calls `sanctuary-cortex-cortex-capture-snapshot` with `snapshot_type='seal'`.
2.  **Successor Update**: The tool generates the final `learning_package_snapshot.md` for total technical continuity. 
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Meta-Preservation**: The manifest for the Seal MUST include this SOP (`.agent/workflows/sanctuary_protocols/sanctuary-recursive-learning.md`) if any logical optimizations were made during the session.
3.  **Preservation**: Commit all learning artifacts as per Protocol 101 Preservation.

---

### Next Session: The Bridge
1. **Boot**: The next session agent calls `cortex_learning_debrief`.
2. **Retrieve**: The tool identifies the `learning_package_snapshot.md` and presents it as the "Strategic Successor Context".

## Phase 9: Retrospective (Continuous Improvement)
1.  **Reflect:** Did this session feel efficient? Were there friction points?
2.  **Friction Log**: Record observations in `.agent/frictionlogs/` for process improvement.
3.  **Optimize:**
    *   If a tool failed >2 times, note it for Tool Hardening.
    *   If the workflow felt rigid, update this file immediately.
4.  **Log:** If significant improvements were identified, mention them in the Chronicle Entry.
