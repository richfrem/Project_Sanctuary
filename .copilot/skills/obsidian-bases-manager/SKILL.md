# Obsidian Bases Manager

**Status:** Active
**Author:** Sanctuary Guardian
**Domain:** Obsidian Integration
**Depends On:** `obsidian-vault-crud` (WP06)

## Purpose

Obsidian Bases are `.base` files containing YAML that defines database-like views
over vault notes. This skill enables agents to act as database administrators —
reading, appending rows, and updating cell values while preserving the view
configuration (columns, filters, sorts) untouched.

## Available Commands

### Read a Base
```bash
python plugins/obsidian-integration/skills/obsidian-bases-manager/scripts/bases_ops.py read --file <path.base>
```

### Append a Row
```bash
python plugins/obsidian-integration/skills/obsidian-bases-manager/scripts/bases_ops.py append-row --file <path.base> --data key1=value1 key2=value2
```

### Update a Cell
```bash
python plugins/obsidian-integration/skills/obsidian-bases-manager/scripts/bases_ops.py update-cell --file <path.base> --row-index 0 --column key1 --value "new value"
```

## Safety Guarantees
- Uses `ruamel.yaml` for lossless round-trip YAML parsing
- All writes go through `obsidian-vault-crud` atomic write protocol
- View configurations (columns, filters, sorts, formulas) are never modified
- Malformed YAML triggers a clean error report, never a crash or data loss
