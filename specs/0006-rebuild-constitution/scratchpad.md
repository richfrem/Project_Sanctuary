# Scratchpad: Spec 0006 - Rebuild Constitution

## Ideas / Parking Lot
- Consider adding a "Violation Counter" mechanism that agents must self-report.
- Explore if there's a way to make violation detection automatic (pre-commit hook?).

## Notes
- User frustrated by habitual non-compliance. Root cause: Constitution is too long and Human Gate is buried.
