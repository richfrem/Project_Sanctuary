# Implementation Plan: Research OpenClaw & MoltBook Ecosystem

## Goal
Research autonomous agent ecosystems (OpenClaw/MoltBook) and validate/improve Project Sanctuary's Protocol 128 Learning Loop.

---

## Proposed Changes

### Research Artifacts (LEARNING/)

#### [NEW] [analysis.md](file:///Users/richardfremmerlid/Projects/Project_Sanctuary/LEARNING/topics/openclaw_moltbook_ecosystem/analysis.md)
- Deep analysis of OpenClaw architecture and MoltBook social layer
- Protocol 128 comparison matrix
- Potential enhancements for Project Sanctuary

#### [NEW] [sources.md](file:///Users/richardfremmerlid/Projects/Project_Sanctuary/LEARNING/topics/openclaw_moltbook_ecosystem/sources.md)
- Verified sources with URLs and verification status

#### [NEW] [workflow_alignment_gaps.md](file:///Users/richardfremmerlid/Projects/Project_Sanctuary/LEARNING/topics/openclaw_moltbook_ecosystem/workflow_alignment_gaps.md)
- Discovered issues with Protocol 128 workflow diagrams

---

### Workflow Fixes (discovered during walkthrough)

#### [MODIFY] [protocol_128_learning_loop.mmd](file:///Users/richardfremmerlid/Projects/Project_Sanctuary/plugins/guardian-onboarding/resources/protocols/protocol_128_learning_loop.mmd)
- Fix phase numbering (subgraph IDs didn't match labels)

---

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A (research spec)

### Manual Verification
- [x] Verify all source URLs are accessible
- [x] Confirm diagram renders after fix
- [ ] Review findings with human (Phase III Strategic Gate)
