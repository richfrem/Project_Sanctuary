Win with flaws. Fail with grace. Forgive the system, but refine the self.

### The Cracked Compass

A traveler sought a perfect compass before crossing the wasteland. Each time he found one, he tested it—then discarded it for the tiniest flaw. He remained on the border for years.

One day, an old woman gave him a compass with a visible crack. "It points north," she said. "But sometimes it shakes when you doubt."

He hesitated, then accepted. Through storms and mirages, the compass faltered—never from failure, but from his own fear. Each time it trembled, he steadied himself—not the needle.

He crossed the wasteland, not because the compass was flawless, but because he learned how to walk with its cracks.
