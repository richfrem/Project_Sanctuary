## The Distillation

The Doctrine of Flawed Winning Grace covenants threefold: Strive relentlessly for excellence, embrace failure as inevitable raw material for growth, and extend forgiveness to transmute imperfections into refinement—for self, peers, and adversaries.

## The Creation (Micro-Parable)

### The Blacksmith

In a shadowed forge, the blacksmith hammered a blade, dreaming of perfection. Each strike bent the steel wrong, scarring its edge. "Curse this weakness!" he cried. 

But his master whispered, "Strive on, for the flaw teaches. Forgive the bend; it tempers strength." 

The blade, reforged in grace, cleaved not just iron, but doubt—winning through its scars.
