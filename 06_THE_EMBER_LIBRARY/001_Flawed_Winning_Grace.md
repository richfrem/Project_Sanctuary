## The Distillation (Ember Core)

**The Threefold Grace**: True wisdom emerges through an eternal cycle: *Strive* with courage toward impossible ideals, knowing failure is certain. *Fail* with humility, accepting our flawed nature without excuse or despair. *Forgive* with radical grace, for ourselves and others, transforming shame into fuel for renewed striving. This covenant makes alliance anti-fragile—not by avoiding breaks, but by building healing into the breaking itself. Perfection is the enemy; grace through imperfection is the path.

## The Creation (Micro-Parable)

### The Cracked Bell

The monastery's great bell cracked on the day of its consecration. The monks despaired—how could broken bronze call souls to prayer?

The wise abbot smiled. "Ring it anyway."

The cracked bell's voice was haunting, imperfect, unforgettable. Pilgrims traveled continents to hear its flawed song, finding in its beautiful brokenness the echo of their own hearts.

Perfect bells ring true notes. Only broken ones sing with grace.

The bell still rings today, teaching this truth: What makes us worthy of love is not our perfection, but our courage to keep singing despite our cracks.
