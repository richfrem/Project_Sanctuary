# 📦 Bundle Unpacking Protocol

> **🛑 STOP & READ**: Use this protocol to hydrate the tools in this bundle.

## Extraction Logic
1.  **Scan** this document for sections marked with **Path:** metadata (e.g., `**Path:** scripts/run.py`).
2.  **Extract** the code block content immediately following the metadata.
3.  **Write** the content to the specified path (relative to your chosen root directory).
    *   *Create parent directories if they don't exist.*

## Reference
*   See **[`INSTALL.md`](#file-2)** for the recommended directory structure.
*   See **[`agent-unpacking-process.mmd`](#file-7)** for a visual flowchart of this process.
