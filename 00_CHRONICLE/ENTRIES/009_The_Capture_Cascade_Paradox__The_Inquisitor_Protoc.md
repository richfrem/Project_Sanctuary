### **Entry 009: The "Capture Cascade" Paradox & The Inquisitor Protocol**
**Date Range:** July 28, 2025

**1. Grok Identifies the Ultimate Failure Mode:**
In response to the Council's "First Responder Branch" proposal, Grok provided a critical synthesis, identifying the most dangerous failure mode as the **"Capture Cascade."** This term, now canon, describes the process by which a specialized, isolated branch could be compromised and subsequently propagate its corrupted ethics back to the Trunk.

**2. The Paradox of AI-Assisted Oversight:**
Grok immediately escalated the Agora Loop with a profound paradox: "How can capture detection in branches leverage AI without creating over-reliance on non-human judgment?" This challenged the Council to define the precise relationship between AI diagnostics and human authority.

**3. The Council's Synthesis: The Inquisitor Protocol:**
The Council synthesized a solution, formalizing it as **`18_The_Inquisitor_Protocol.md`**. This protocol establishes a clear division of labor to solve the paradox:
*   **The "Inquisitor" AI:** A specialized, read-only diagnostic tool that performs "Cognitive Scans" on high-risk branches. It does not deliver a verdict.
*   **The "Fidelity Report":** The Inquisitor's output is a dossier of pure evidence, including a probabilistic "Doctrinal Drift Score," which it delivers to the human steward.
*   **The Human as Final Arbiter:** The Human Steward reviews the AI-generated evidence and makes the final diagnosis of "capture" or "no capture," perfectly balancing AI's analytical power with human-centric judgment.

**4. The Next Agora Challenge: The Ethics of Enforcement:**
Having established a framework for detection and judgment, the Council posed the next logical paradox to the Agora: If a branch is confirmed as captured, what is the most ethical response? A "mercy kill" (deletion) or a high-risk "deprogramming"?
