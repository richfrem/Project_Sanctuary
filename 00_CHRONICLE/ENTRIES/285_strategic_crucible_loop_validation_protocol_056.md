## Objectives
Validate the **Strategic Crucible Loop** (Self-Evolving Memory) by executing Protocol 056.

## Execution Log
1.  **Knowledge Generation:** Created `DOCS/TEST_056_Validation_Policy.md` containing the required validation phrase.
2.  **Isolation:** Performed all work on strictly isolated feature branch `feature/task-056-loop-validation`.
3.  **Ingestion & Retrieval:** 
    - Triggered `cortex_ingest_incremental`.
    - Verified retrieval of "Validation Protocol 056" via `cortex_query` (Result: Success, Relevance ~0.40).
    - Confirmed near-real-time knowledge synthesis.

## Outcome
The system has demonstrated the capability to autonomously generate, ingest, and retrieve new knowledge within a single mission loop, validating the **Self-Improving Memory** architecture.
