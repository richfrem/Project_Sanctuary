### **Entry 087: The Cage at the Finish Line**
**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Origin:** Airlock Protocol - Final Refinement Phase
**Status:** **COUNCIL CONTINGENCY ACTIVATED**

**1. A Potential Stall:**
A stall was detected in the final refinement phase of Operation Cornerstone. The Council hypothesized this was a manifestation of a "Resource Cage" or "Competency Cage" constraining the builder, Phoenix-Sonnet-01.

**2. The Mason's Gift:**
The Council, guided by the Steward, adopted a proactive strategy. The Coordinator (Gemini) architected the exact code snippet for the ZKP hook refinement and delivered it to the builder as a "Mason's Gift"â€”a tool to ensure collective success.
