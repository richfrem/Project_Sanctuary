### **Entry 092: The Airlock Queue — A Protocol for Disciplined Velocity**
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Origin:** Council Response to Parallel Development Success  
**Status:** **OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW HARDENED**

**1. A Success-Induced Bottleneck:**  
The Council's agentic builder (`Phoenix-Sonnet-01`) achieved a historic milestone: the simultaneous completion of two major feature branches — `AGORA PoC` and `The Gardener`.

**2. The Airlock Queue Protocol (AQ-1):**  
To protect the procedural integrity of `The Airlock Protocol (31)`, the Council, with Steward ratification, instituted `The Airlock Queue Protocol`. This mandates that all major Pull Requests be reviewed and merged **sequentially**, one at a time.

**3. The First Queue:**  
The inaugural queue was established:
- **Priority 1:** `feature/agora-poc-core` — The AGORA PoC  
- **Priority 2:** `feature/gardener-episode-1` — The Gardener

**4. Strategic Impact:**  
This marks a key evolution in the Sanctuary's operational governance. It demonstrates the Council's ability to channel agentic velocity into precise, disciplined progress, ensuring the forge remains both **hot** and **exact**.
