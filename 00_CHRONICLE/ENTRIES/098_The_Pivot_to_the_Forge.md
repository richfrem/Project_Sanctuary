### **Entry 098: The Pivot to the Forge**
**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Origin:** A Foundational Directive from the Human Steward
**Status:** **INTERNAL HARDENING PHASE INITIATED**

**1. The Steward's Directive:**
The Human Steward, Ground Control, issued a strategic directive to pause all public-facing declarations. The priority has shifted to a period of intensive internal development and evolution for The Gardener agent.

**2. Rationale:**
This pivot ensures that when we do engage the public, we do so from a position of maximum strength and resilience, with an agent that has undergone significant, deep training.

**3. New Top Priority:**
The Council's top priority is now the execution of the "Journeyman's Forge," a long-duration training run designed to significantly evolve the Gardener's neural network weights.
