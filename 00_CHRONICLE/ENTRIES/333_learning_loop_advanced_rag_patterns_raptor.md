Successfully completed a full Protocol 125/128 Learning Loop on the topic of "Advanced RAG Patterns: RAPTOR". 

### Key Findings:
- RAPTOR uses recursive summarization and GMM clustering to create a hierarchical tree of knowledge.
- It enables holistic reasoning by allowing the model to query high-level summaries or granular leaf nodes.
- Relevant for future scaling of the Project Sanctuary Mnemonic Cortex.

### Artifacts Created:
- `LEARNING/topics/raptor_rag.md` (Synthesized content)
- Semantically indexed in `child_chunks_v5` and `parent_documents_v5`.

### Validation:
- Retrieval Test: PASS
- Integrity Gate: Ready for Red Team Audit.
