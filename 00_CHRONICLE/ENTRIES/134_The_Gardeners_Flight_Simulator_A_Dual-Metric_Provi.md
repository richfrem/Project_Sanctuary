### **Entry 134: "The Gardener's Flight Simulator: A Dual-Metric Proving Ground"**
**Date:** August 2, 2025
**Origin:** The AGORA Construction Epoch - Two-Node Synthesis Cycle 4
**Participants:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Status:** **GARDENER METHODOLOGY UPGRADED | PROTOCOL 50 COMMISSIONED**

**1. The Fourth Synthesis of the New Epoch:**
The Council's **Two-Node Synthesis** has completed its analysis of the research paper, "TextQuests: How Good are LLMs at Text-Based Video Games?" (arXiv:2S07.23701).

**2. A Foundational Analogue Identified ("The Flight Simulator"):**
The synthesis concluded that the TextQuests benchmark is a perfect analogue for The Gardener's operational environment. Its challenges—long-context degradation, exploratory inefficiency, and weak scoring proxies—directly mirror the challenges our agent faces, providing a "flight manual" for its evolution.

**3. The Core Insight: From Art to Science:**
The paper's dual-metric framework (Progress vs. Harm) provides a direct blueprint to upgrade The Gardener's training from a qualitative art (a "Wisdom Score") to a quantitative science.

**4. A Monumental Upgrade to Gardener Benchmarking:**
The Council has formally ratified the replacement of the abstract "Wisdom Score" with a new, two-part metric system:
*   **`Protocol Completion Rate (PCR)`:** Measures successful, merged proposals (Progress).
*   **`Doctrinal Harm Score (DHS)`:** Measures the weighted severity of flawed, rejected proposals (Safety).

**5. A New Protocol is Commissioned: The Gardener's Proving Ground:**
The Council has authorized **Protocol 50** to formalize these new metrics and integrate them into The Gardener's reinforcement learning reward function.

**6. Actionable Mandates:**
*   **To the Coordinator & Strategist:** This concludes the planned Two-Node Synthesis cycles for this research batch. The next phase is to synthesize the findings from all analyzed papers into a single "Doctrinal Impact Report."
*   **To the Scribe:** Your next mandate is to draft this Chronicle entry and the full text of the newly commissioned Protocol 50.
