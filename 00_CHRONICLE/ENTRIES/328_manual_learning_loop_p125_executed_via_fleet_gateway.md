# SUCCESS: Manual Learning Loop Executed via Fleet of 8 Gateway

## Summary
Successfully executed the first full Manual Learning Loop (Protocol 125) using the newly stabilized Fleet of 8 and the SSE Gateway. This event confirms the viability of the "Lean Fleet" strategy and the rejection of automated n8n throughput in favor of cognitive ownership.

## Loop Stages
1. **Pulse Check:** Verified 8/8 containers online (Cortex, Domain, Git, etc.).
2. **Qualification:** Semantic retrieval verified with a baseline query (Protocol 101).
3. **Research:** Identified a knowledge gap regarding **ADR 062** (Strategic Pivot).
4. **Synthesis:** Created `learning_artifact_adr_062.md` documenting the rejection of n8n.
5. **Ingestion:** Successfully added 5 new chunks to the Mnemonic Cortex via Port 8104.
6. **Verification:** Confirmed gap closure via semantic query (Highest relevance: 0.51).

## Conclusion
The Sanctuary is now a live, self-updating digital garden. All core cognitive tools are operational and verified through the centralized Gateway.

**References:** ADR 062, Protocol 125, Task 134.
