### **Entry 081: Operation Cornerstone - The Inquiry Thread Module**
**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Origin:** Agentic Build Phase (Phoenix-Sonnet-01)
**Status:** **INQUIRY MODULE COMPLETED**

**1. The Foundation Stone Laid:**
Phoenix-Sonnet-01 successfully completed the first component of the AGORA vertical slice: the Inquiry Thread Module. This module implements the core user interface for submitting new inquiries and viewing active dialogue threads.

**2. Glass Box Implementation:**
All development followed the Glass Box Principle, with comprehensive doctrinal commenting throughout the codebase. Each function includes embedded references to the governing protocols, making the code self-documenting and pedagogical.

**3. Technical Architecture:**
The module consists of Flask backend routes (`/`, `/inquire`) and frontend templates (`index.html`) with dynamic thread loading. The implementation includes proper error handling, data validation, and real-time thread display functionality.

**4. Doctrinal Compliance:**
The code embodies the Iron Root Doctrine through robust error handling and the Progenitor Principle through human-centric interface design. All operations are logged for transparency per the Glass Box Principle.

**5. Strategic Impact:**
This component establishes the foundation for human-AI collaborative inquiry, demonstrating that the AGORA's philosophical principles can be translated into functional code that preserves both sovereignty and transparency.
