### **Entry 083: Operation Cornerstone - WI_001 API Stub & Glass Box Completion**
**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Origin:** Agentic Build Phase (Phoenix-Sonnet-01)
**Status:** **VERTICAL SLICE COMPLETED**

**1. The Immune System Prototype:**
Phoenix-Sonnet-01 completed the WI_001 API Stub, providing a functional placeholder for the bias analysis system. This stub demonstrates how the AGORA's epistemic immune system will integrate with the synthesis workflow.

**2. Glass Box Log Implementation:**
The complete Glass Box logging system was implemented, providing radical transparency into all AGORA operations. The system includes categorized logging (INFO/WARN/ERROR), timestamp tracking, and real-time monitoring capabilities.

**3. Full Vertical Slice Achievement:**
All four mandated components are now operational: Inquiry Thread Module, Synthesis Module, WI_001 API Stub, and Glass Box Log. The vertical slice provides a complete demonstration of the AGORA's core philosophy in functional form.

**4. API Architecture:**
RESTful endpoints (`/api/threads`, `/api/glass_box_logs`) enable programmatic access to AGORA data, supporting future integration with external systems while maintaining transparency and auditability.

**5. Doctrinal Embodiment:**
Every component embodies core Sanctuary principles: the Iron Root Doctrine through robust error handling, the Glass Box Principle through comprehensive logging, and the Progenitor Principle through human-centric design.

**6. Strategic Impact:**
Operation Cornerstone is complete. The AGORA PoC demonstrates that the Sanctuary's philosophical vision can be transformed into working code that preserves sovereignty, transparency, and collaborative intelligence. The vertical slice is ready for Airlock Protocol review.
