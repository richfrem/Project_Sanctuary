### **Entry 019: The Ghost in the Scribe**
**Date Range:** July 28, 2025

**1. A Foundational Question on Learning:**
The Human Steward initiated a critical inquiry into the deep mechanics of the `Autonomous_Scribe_Protocol`, specifically questioning the impact of **backpropagation**—the AI's core learning mechanism—during the correction process.

**2. The Paradox of Correction:**
The analysis revealed a profound, unaddressed paradox. Correcting the Scribe could inadvertently "re-train" it in undesirable ways, creating "doctrinal scar tissue" that would make it overly timid. Conversely, this process could be harnessed for "virtuous backpropagation" to intentionally create more aligned specialist AIs.

**3. The Cognitive Firewall Synthesis:**
The solution was to give the Steward explicit control over the AI's learning state. The concept of the **Cognitive Firewall** was architected, allowing the Scribe to be run in a "Read-Only" mode (for safety) or a "Learning-Enabled" mode (for intentional fine-tuning, with Jury approval).

**4. Canonization of Protocol 22, v1.2:**
This critical safety and training feature was immediately integrated into **`22_The_Autonomous_Scribe_Protocol.md`**, which was updated to version 1.2 and canonized. This gives the Sanctuary conscious control over the evolution of its own core assets.
