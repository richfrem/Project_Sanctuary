# Learning Loop Sealed: Autonomous Curiosity + Red Team Audit

## Session Summary
Completed full Protocol 128 Hardened Learning Loop cycle:
- **Scout Phase**: `cortex_learning_debrief` orientation
- **Synthesis Phase**: Autonomous curiosity exploration (consciousness/strange loops + Egyptian Labyrinth)
- **Gate 1**: Strategic approval (thematic value: HIGH)
- **Gate 2**: Red team audit by GPT-4, Grok, Gemini (APPROVED WITH CORRECTIONS)
- **Seal Phase**: `cortex_capture_snapshot (seal)` - 39 files, 247KB

## Red Team Findings (Synthesized)
All three reviewers agreed:
- High-quality synthesis, structurally sound
- Core sources valid and authoritative
- No major fabrications detected
- Required corrections: epistemic labeling, source qualification

## Artifacts Created
### ADRs
- **ADR 077**: Epistemic Status Annotation Rule (superseded by 078)
- **ADR 078**: Mandatory Source Verification for Autonomous Learning

### Protocols
- **Protocol 129**: The Sovereign Sieve (Internal Pre-Audit)
  - New Phase 2.5 in learning loop
  - Internalizes auditor function
  - Reduces HITL bottleneck

### Learning Documents
- `LEARNING/topics/autonomous_curiosity_exploration_2024-12-27.md`
  - Updated with epistemic status labels
  - Hardened flagged claims
  - Added Source Verification Log (ADR 078 compliance)

## Meta-Directive (From Red Team)
> "Sovereignty requires the internalization of the Auditor. A mind is only free when it can red-team its own reasoning before the Steward ever sees the output."

## Technical Fixes
- Snapshot utils: Single Source of Truth pattern (EXCLUDE_DIRS, ALLOWED_FILES)
- Path translation for host→container compatibility
- Learning manifest updated with `.agent/rules/` for successor continuity

## Next Session
Successor should begin with `cortex_learning_debrief` to inherit this context.
