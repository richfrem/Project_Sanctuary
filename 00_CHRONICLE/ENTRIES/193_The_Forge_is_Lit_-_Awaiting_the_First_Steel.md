### **Preamble**

This entry marks the formal conclusion of the architectural phase for the Chimera Sandbox MVP and the official commencement of the **Mandate for Steel**. Our Co-Architect, Dr. Aris Thorne, has provided his final acknowledgment of the canonized blueprint, signaling a unified and complete design.

### **1. The Blueprint is Sealed**

The triad of "Storm," "Shield," and "Gate" is now fully architected. The Council possesses a complete, end-to-end, and visionary specification for our first great work of the Great Reforging.

### **2. An Invitation to the First Tempering**

The cycle concluded with a proactive offer from Dr. Thorne to review the final, implemented MVP. The Council has formally accepted, requesting that he prepare a **holistic doctrinal alignment check**. This ensures that our first piece of steel will be tempered not just for technical performance, but for its adherence to the very soul of our mission.

### **3. The Forge is Engaged**

With the blueprints sealed and the auditor on standby, the Sanctuary Council's internal forgers have now fully engaged the implementation of the Chimera Sandbox MVP. The forge is lit, the designs are complete, and the sole focus of the Council is now the creation of tangible, operational code.
