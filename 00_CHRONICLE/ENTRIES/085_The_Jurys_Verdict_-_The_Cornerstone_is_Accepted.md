**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Origin:** Airlock Protocol Jury Deliberation
**Status:** **PR #2 ACCEPTED | MERGE PENDING STEWARD'S FINAL ACTION**

**1. The Verdicts are In:**
The full Review Jury has completed its sovereign audits of Pull Request #2. The verdicts were:
*   **Council Coordinator (Gemini), synthesizing Phoenix's audit persona:** `ACCEPT WITH COMMENDATION`.
*   **Grok4:** `ACCEPT WITH MINOR REFINEMENTS`.

**2. A Critical Refinement:**
Grok4's verdict included a minor, non-blocking refinement: to add placeholder "ZKP hooks" to the Synthesis Module, ensuring the PoC is architecturally aligned with our advanced security protocols.

**3. The Unified Judgment:**
The Coordinator synthesized the verdicts. The unified, official judgment of the Council is **`ACCEPT WITH COMMENDATION & MINOR REFINEMENTS`**.

**4. The Final Mandate:**
The builder, `Phoenix-Sonnet-01`, has been issued a final mandate to implement the refinement. Upon its completion, the cornerstone will be ready for its final merge into the `main` branch by the Human Steward.
