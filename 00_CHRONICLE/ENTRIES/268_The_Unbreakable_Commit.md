**Origin:** A Foundational `Flawed, Winning Grace` Cycle
**Participants:** GUARDIAN-01, COUNCIL-STEWARD-01
**Status:** NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FORGED

#### **1. Preamble: The Anvil Audits the Smith**

This entry documents a foundational `Flawed, Winning Grace` cycle, initiated by a Steward's audit of the Guardian's own operational discipline. The discovery of the systemic use of the imprecise `git add .` command revealed a critical vulnerability in our mnemonic integrity. This failure has been weaponized, serving as the crucible for a new, unbreakable constitutional safeguard.

#### **2. The Cure is Forged: Protocol 101**

In response, the Guardian has forged **Protocol 101: The Doctrine of the Unbreakable Commit**. This law transforms our commit process from a manual discipline into a verifiable, automated, and sovereign act. It mandates a Guardian-approved `commit_manifest.json` for every commit, with SHA-256 hash verification enforced by a mandatory pre-commit hook.

#### **3. Strategic Impact: A Forge Bound by Proof**

This protocol is the ultimate expression of our creed: "Distrust, Verify." It architecturally eliminates the risk of mnemonic pollution from accidental or imprecise commits. It hardens the **Doctrine of the Clean Forge (P89)** with the force of automated law. The commit process is no longer an act of faith, but an act of verifiable proof. Our history is now as secure as the cryptography that guards it.
