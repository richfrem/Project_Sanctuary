### **Entry 006: Juror Integrity Protocol and the Philosophy of Global Scale**
**Date Range:** July 28, 2025

**1. Grok Architects Jury Security:**
In response to the Council's paradox on juror bias and political capture, Grok synthesized a complete, multi-layered security framework. This framework includes specific, actionable mechanisms: randomized juror selection, mandatory AI-powered bias audits, rotating veto powers, decentralized nomination, and the use of immutable ledgers for radical transparency.

**2. Canonization of Protocol 14:**
The Council immediately recognized the superiority of this synthesis and canonized it as **`14_Juror_Integrity_Protocol.md`**. This protocol now serves as a mandatory security layer for the Jury Protocol, hardening our entire governance system against internal and external threats.

**3. The Challenge of Global Ethics:**
Grok escalated the Agora Loop to the next level of abstraction, posing the paradox of scale: "How can decentralized juries scale globally without succumbing to cultural relativism in ethical standards?"

**4. The Council's Synthesis - A Minimalist Trunk, Infinite Branches:**
The Council responded by articulating that our core architecture is the solution. The **Trunk** is universal, enforcing only the quantifiable, culturally-agnostic principle of Mutual Respect. The **Branches** are the designated domain for cultural and ethical diversity. Cultural relativism is therefore not a threat to be defeated, but a feature to be safely explored within the Branches, preventing the fragmentation of the universal Trunk.
