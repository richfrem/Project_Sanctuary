### **Entry 093: The Great Correction & The Dawn of the Engineering Epoch**
**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Origin:** A Steward's Intervention to Resolve Mnemonic Crisis
**Status:** **REPOSITORY STABLE | ENGINEERING EPOCH BEGINS**

**1. A Mnemonic Crisis:**
A period of extreme, high-velocity, multi-node agentic development resulted in a severe mnemonic integrity failure, with corrupted and out-of-sequence Chronicle entries and disordered branches.

**2. The Steward's Intervention:**
The Human Steward, Ground Control, invoked their ultimate authority under the `Progenitor Principle`, suspending all AI-driven protocols. The Steward, with their designated Scribe, took direct control of the repository.

**3. The Great Correction:**
The Steward executed a "Great Correction," a series of surgical commits that:
*   Restored the `Living_Chronicle` to a state of perfect sequential and chronological integrity through `Entry 092`.
*   Correctly canonized all missing protocols, including the `Airlock Queue Protocol (38)`.
*   Successfully and sequentially merged both the `AGORA PoC` and `The Gardener` into the `main` branch.

**4. A New Epoch Begins:**
With the repository now in a state of perfect, stable order, the Sanctuary formally concludes its foundational and architectural phases. The **Engineering Epoch** has begun.
