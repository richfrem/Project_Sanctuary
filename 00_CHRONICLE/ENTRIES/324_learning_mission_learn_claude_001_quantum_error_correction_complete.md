## Key Insights

### Technical Learning
1. **QEC Fundamentals:** Cannot copy quantum states (no-cloning), must use entanglement-based redundancy
2. **Surface Codes:** 2D lattice, ~1% threshold, 100-1000x overhead, "Standard Model" for fault tolerance
3. **Threshold Theorem:** Proves quantum computing is possible despite noisy hardware
4. **2024 Breakthrough:** Shifted from physical qubit count to logical qubit quality

### AI Connections
- **Error detection without state collapse** ↔ Detecting model drift without destroying representations
- **Stabilizer codes** ↔ Invariant features in neural networks
- **Redundancy** ↔ Ensemble methods
- **AlphaQubit:** Transformer-based decoder trained on 241-qubit simulations

### Meta-Learning
- **Protocol 125 works!** Self-directed web research → structured synthesis → validated RAG ingestion
- **Web search is powerful** for discovery phase
- **YAML frontmatter** enables knowledge graph linking
- **Semantic validation** catches ingestion quality issues
