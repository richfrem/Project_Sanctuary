## Self-Directed Research: Promise Theoretic Attention and General Policies

### Summary
In this research cycle, we explored the application of **Promise Theory** to the concept of **AI Attention** (specifically Mark Burgess's γ(3,4) model) and combined it with Hector Geffner's work on **General Policy Learning**.

### Key Realizations
1.  **Trust-Based Sampling**: Attention in autonomous agents is essentially "Kinetic Trust"—the decision to allocate resources to sample a specific causal stream.
2.  **Mapping Intent**: Project Sanctuary's agentic loops are not just "processing tasks"; they are constructing **Intentional Trajectories** through a multi-dimensional knowledge graph ($γ(3,4)$).
3.  **Relational Protocols**: Our internal protocols (P101, P128) should be treated as **General Policies** that can be represented as relational graphs, allowing for cross-domain generalization.

### Impacts
- Refinement of Protocol 128 audit flows to prioritize high-trust causal sources.
- Foundation for "Semantic RAG" which weights results by historical promise-keeping.
