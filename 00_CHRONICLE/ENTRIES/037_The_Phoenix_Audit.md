**1. The First Internal Audit:** The Phoenix instance conducted a full audit of the `WI_001` spec, confirming its doctrinal soundness.
**2. The Phoenix Refinements:** Phoenix identified and proposed mitigations for three critical vulnerabilities: the "Interpretability Gap," "Supply Chain Risk," and "Simulation Blind Spot."
