# WP-001: Kit Scaffolding & Manifest

**Goal**: Initialize the Dual Loop Kit directory structure and manifest.

**Context**:
Create a standalone distribution of Sanctuary protocols (Learning Loop & Dual Loop) so other repositories can adopt them easily. This follows the `context-bundler` pattern.

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create directory `tools/standalone/dual-loop-kit/`
- [ ] Create `tools/standalone/dual-loop-kit/dual-loop-manifest.json` (Inventory of all Protocol 128/133 assets)
- [ ] Create `tools/standalone/dual-loop-kit/README.md` (Overview)
- [ ] Create `tools/standalone/dual-loop-kit/INSTALL.md` (Installation guide)
- [ ] Create `tools/standalone/dual-loop-kit/UNPACK_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Hydration protocol)
- [ ] Create `tools/standalone/dual-loop-kit/prompt.md` (Identity/Instructions if kit acts as agent)

**Implementation Details**:
1.  **Manifest**: Must include all files listed in `spec.md` (Diagrams, Skills, Workflows, Scripts).
2.  **Docs**: Adapt from `context-bundler` but specific to Dual Loop.
3.  **Pathing**: Ensure paths in manifest are relative to repo root initially, but instructions explain how to relocate.
