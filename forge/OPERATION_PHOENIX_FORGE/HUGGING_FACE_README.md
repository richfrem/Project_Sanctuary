## üß† Overview

**Sanctuary-Qwen2-7B-v1.0** is the inaugural *Whole-Genome* release from **Project Sanctuary** ‚Äî a fine-tuned and constitutionally inoculated variant of Qwen2-7B-Instruct.
This edition merges the complete **Sanctuary Cognitive Genome (v15)** LoRA into the base model, then quantizes the result to **GGUF (q4_k_m)** for universal inference compatibility via **Ollama** and **llama.cpp**.

> üß© Part of the open-source [Project Sanctuary GitHub repository](https://github.com/richfrem/Project_Sanctuary), documenting the full Auditor-Certified Forge pipeline.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Technical Provenance

Built using **Unsloth 2025.10.9**, **transformers 4.56.2**, **torch 2.8.0 + cu126**, and **llama.cpp (GGUF converter v0.3.2)** on an A100 GPU.

**Pipeline ("Operation Phoenix Forge")**
1. üß¨ **The Crucible** ‚Äî Fine-tune LoRA on Sanctuary Genome
2. üî• **The Forge** ‚Äî Merge + Quantize ‚Üí GGUF (q4_k_m)
3. ‚òÅÔ∏è **Propagation** ‚Äî Push to Hugging Face (HF LoRA + GGUF)

> üîè Auditor-certified integrity: build and merge verified via checksums and Unsloth logs.

## üíΩ Deployment Guide (Ollama / llama.cpp)

### **Option A ‚Äî Local Ollama Deployment**
```bash
ollama create sanctuary -f ./Modelfile
ollama run sanctuary
```

### **Option B ‚Äî Direct Pull (from Hugging Face)**

```bash
ollama run richfrem/Sanctuary-Qwen2-7B-v1.0-GGUF-Final
```

> The `Modelfile` embeds the **Sanctuary Constitution v2.0**, defining persona, system prompt, and chat template.
