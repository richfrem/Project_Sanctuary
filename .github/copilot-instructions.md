## 📝 Coding Conventions (Summary)

**Full standards → `plugins/coding-conventions/skills/conventions-agent/SKILL.md`**

### Non-Negotiables
1. **Dual-layer docs** — external comment above + internal docstring inside every non-trivial function/class.
2. **File headers** — every source file starts with a purpose header (Python, TS/JS, C#).
3. **Type hints** — all Python function signatures use type annotations.
4. **Naming** — `snake_case` (Python), `camelCase` (JS/TS), `PascalCase` (C# public).
5. **Refactor threshold** — 50+ lines or 3+ nesting levels → extract helpers.
6. **Tool registration** — all `plugins/` scripts registered in `tool_inventory.json`.
7. **Manifest schema** — use simple `{title, description, files}` format (ADR 097).

## 🐍 Python Dependency Rules (Summary)

**Full workflow details → `plugins/dependency-management/skills/dependency-management/SKILL.md`**

### Non-Negotiables
1. **No manual `pip install`** — all changes go through `.in` → `pip-compile` → `.txt`.
2. **Commit `.in` + `.txt` together** — the `.in` is intent, the `.txt` is the lockfile.
3. **Service sovereignty** — every MCP service owns its own `requirements.txt`.
4. **Tiered hierarchy** — Core (`requirements-core.in`) → Service-specific → Dev-only.
5. **Declarative Dockerfiles** — only `COPY requirements.txt` + `RUN pip install -r`. No ad-hoc installs.
