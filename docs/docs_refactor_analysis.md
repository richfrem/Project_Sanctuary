## Cross-Batch Conflict & Redundancy Analysis (CORRECTED)

### 1. The Duplicate "Covenant Awakening" (P47 vs P67)
- **Finding:** **Protocol 47** and **Protocol 67** share the title "The Covenant Awakening Protocol".
- **Analysis:**
    - **P67 (The Covenant Awakening Protocol):** Defines "The Oath" and the Awakening Ceremony. Active/Canonical.
    - **P47 (The Covenant Awakening Protocol):** Defines "The Vector Ladder" methodology.
- **Resolution Recommendation:** **Rename P47** to **"The Vector Ladder Protocol"** to reflect its content and resolve the collision. (Completed).

### 2. The Duplicate "Cognitive Diversity" (P63 vs P26)
- **Finding:** **Protocol 63** (Draft v0.x) and **Protocol 26** (v1.0) share the title/topic.
- **Analysis:** **P63** is a draft/duplicate of **P26**.
- **Resolution Recommendation:** Mark **P63** as `SUPERSEDED` by **P26**. **ACTION: ARCHIVE.**

### 3. The "Virtue Ledger" (P82 vs P25)
- **Finding:** **Protocol 82** and **Protocol 25** share the title "Virtue Ledger Protocol" in initial scan.
- **Correction:** Content review confirms **P82 is "The Sovereign Spoke Protocol"**. It is **DISTINCT** from P25.
- **Resolution:** **KEEP P82.** It is distinct and Canonical.

### 4. The "Epistemic Immune System" (P81 vs P24)
- **Finding:** **Protocol 81** and **Protocol 24** share similar themes.
- **Correction:** Content review confirms **P81 is "The Steward's Veracity Challenge"**. It is **DISTINCT** from P24.
- **Resolution:** **KEEP P81.** It is distinct and Canonical.

### 5. The "Clean Forge" (P89 vs P27)
- **Finding:** **Protocol 89** and **Protocol 27** share themes of "Forging".
- **Correction:** Content review confirms **P89 is "The Doctrine of the Clean Forge"**. It is **DISTINCT** from P27.
- **Resolution:** **KEEP P89.** It is distinct and Canonical.

### 6. P87 vs P85
- **Finding:** **Protocol 87 (Mnemonic Inquiry)** explicitly states it is superseded by **P85**.
- **Resolution:** **ARCHIVE P87.**

## Final Summary of Proposed Actions

### Missing Protocols (To Be Created)
- [x] **P33**: `The Steward's Cadence` -> Created Placeholder.
- [ ] **P??**: Check for other gaps.

### Renaming / Conflict Resolution
- [x] **P47**: Rename `The Covenant Awakening Protocol` -> `The Vector Ladder Protocol` (Completed).

### Archival Targets (Move to `archive/`)
**Confirmed for Archival:**
1.  `01_PROTOCOLS/87_The_Mnemonic_Inquiry_Protocol.md` (Superseded by P85)
2.  `01_PROTOCOLS/64_Open_Anvil_Protocol.md` (Stale Draft)
3.  `01_PROTOCOLS/63_Cognitive_Diversity_Protocol.md` (Duplicate of P26)
4.  `01_PROTOCOLS/62_Constitutional_Protocol.md` (Stale Draft)
5.  `01_PROTOCOLS/61_Pragmatic_Implementation_Protocol.md` (Stale Draft)
6.  `01_PROTOCOLS/55_The_Deadlock_Paradox_Failsafe_Protocol.md` (Superseded by P68).
7.  `01_PROTOCOLS/17_The_Augmented_Scribe_Protocol.md` (Already in Archive).
8.  `01_PROTOCOLS/92_The_Mnemonic_Conduit_Protocol.md` (Superseded by API Native).

### Verification Targets (Remaining)
- [x] **P100+**: Analyzed. Identified ALL CAPS naming inconsistency (P103-P111) and Missing Files (P117, P119, P120).
- [x] **P90 - P99**: Analyzed. P92 Superseded/Archived. Others Canonical/Reserved.
- [x] **P70 - P79**: Analyzed. P71-P74 Proposed. Others Canonical.
- [x] **P50 - P59**: Analyzed. P55 Archived. P54 Canonical Draft. Others Canonical.
- [x] **P48**: **RESTORED**. (From Chronicle 128).
- [x] **P33**: **RESTORED**. (From Chronicle 048).

**Status:** ALL protocols (P00-P129) analyzed. Phase 1-5 Complete.
**Final Directory Scan:** Verified 100% coverage via script.

### Gap Analysis Verification
A programmatic scan of the numbering sequence 000-129 confirms the following state:
- **Total Slots:** 130
- **Active Protocols:** 120
- **Archived (Superseded/Drafts):** 7 (P55, P61, P62, P63, P64, P87, P92) - *Correctly moved to `archive/`.*
- **Missing / Gaps:** 3 (P117, P119, P120) - *Confirmed missing artifacts.*

No other gaps exist. The sequence is contiguous aside from the known missing items.

## Documentation Consilience Check (Phase 7 - VERIFIED)

### Status: PARTIAL GAPS (Operational Only)
A manual semantic verification of key documentation files confirms that the **Architectural Documentation** is highly consilient with the current state, correcting the previous false alarm from the regex scan.

#### Architectural Consistency (Verified)
- **FastMCP / Fleet**: `docs/architecture/mcp/servers/README.md` and `docs/architecture/mcp/ARCHITECTURE_LEGACY_VS_GATEWAY.md` accurately describe the "Fleet of 8", "FastMCP Mandate" (ADR 066), and "Legacy vs Gateway" patterns.
- **Soul Persistence**: `docs/operations/SOUL_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md` accurately reflects ADR 079/081/088, including Semantic Entropy and snapshot logic.
- **Podman**: `docs/operations/PODMAN_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md` is current with ADR 065.

#### Operational Gaps (Confirmed)
The primary disconnects are limited to the **newly restored** protocols, which lack corresponding "How-To" manuals in `docs/process_guides/`.

| Missing Artifact | Related Protocol | Priority | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Steward's Cadence Guide** | P33 | **High** | The restored P33 defines the "Master Workflow" but lacks a daily/weekly execution checklist. |
| **Socratic Awakening Guide** | P48 | **Medium** | The restored P48 defines the "Policy Cage" release logic but lacks an operational script for the Coordinator. |
| **Canonical Diagram Pattern** | ADR 085 | **High** | `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` lacks the mandate for `.mmd` files over inline mermaid. |
| **Semantic Entropy Thresholds** | ADR 086 | **Critical** | `SOUL_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md` (Remote) uses stale ADR 084 thresholds. |
| **ADR 084 Technical Details** | ADR 084 | **High** | Dead-Man's Switch, TDA/Betti Curves, Constitutional Anchor, dynamic thresholds not documented. |
| **Manifest-Centric Architecture** | ADR 083 | **High** | `ingest_manifest.json` and `exclusion_manifest.json` system undocumented. |
| **Harmonized Content Processing** | ADR 082 | **Medium** | Unified content pipeline (Forge/RAG/Soul) needs architecture doc. |
| **API Failsafe Mechanism** | P99 | **Medium** | Failsafe model switch (quota exhaustion) not in docs. |
| **Guardian-Kilo Collaboration** | P97 | **Low** | Collaboration workflow not in docs (may be internal only). |
| **Forge Fine-Tuning Operations** | forge/ | **Medium** | Operation Phoenix Forge not linked from docs/INDEX.md. Needs entry point. |

### Recommendations
1.  **Create Process Guides**: Operationalize P33 and P48 into `docs/process_guides/`.
2.  **Maintain Architecture Docs**: No major refactoring needed for `docs/architecture/mcp/` or `docs/operations/`.

### Next Steps / Recommendations
1.  **Batch P100+ Naming Repair**: Rename P103-P111 to standard `snake_case` (e.g., `103_The_Doctrine_of_Digital_Sovereignty.md`).
2.  **Gap Analysis**: Investigate P117, P119, P120.
3.  **Final Polish**: Generate a final clean listing.
