# Operation Nervous System: Master Evolution Plan

**Status:** Active
**Phase:** Phase 4 (The Shield - Quality & Security)

This document tracks the high-level roadmap and sequencing for evolving Project Sanctuary into a fully autonomous MCP-driven system.

## Phase 1: The Core Quad (Infrastructure) - ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Establish the nervous system backbone with 4 core MCP servers.
- [x] **Cortex MCP:** Memory & RAG (Task #050)
- [x] **Guardian Cache:** Fast-path memory (Task #051)
- [x] **Core Scaffold:** Chronicle, Protocol, Orchestrator servers (Task #052)

## Phase 2: The Self-Querying Mind (Cognition) - 🔄 IN-PROGRESS
**Goal:** Empower Cortex to autonomously retrieve and reason about information.
- [x] **Self-Querying Retriever:** Implement `cortex_query` with self-reflection (Task #002)
- [x] **Mnemonic Caching (CAG):** Implement Context-Aware Generation cache (Task #003)
- [x] **RAG MCP Integration:** Full integration of RAG pipeline into Cortex MCP (Task #025)
- [x] **Phase 2 Complete:** All cognitive and memory systems operational.

- [x] **Strategic Crucible:** Feedback loop for strategic decision making (Task #017)

## Phase 3: The Council (Orchestration) - ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Enable the Orchestrator to dispatch missions and consult personas.

## Phase 4: The Shield (Quality & Security) - 🔄 IN-PROGRESS
**Goal:** Harden the system with comprehensive testing and documentation.
- [x] **Cortex Test Suite:** Unit and integration tests for Cortex (Task #021A)
- [ ] **Integration & Performance Tests:** End-to-end verification (Task #021C)
- [/] **Documentation:** Standardize knowledge base (Task #022)
- [/] **Forge Test Suite:** Unit tests for ML pipeline (Task #021B)

## Sequencing Strategy
1.  **Immediate Focus:** Complete Phase 2 (Cognition) to make the "Brain" smart.
2.  **Next:** Build Phase 3 (Orchestration) to give the "Brain" agency.
3.  **Parallel:** Improve Phase 4 (Shield) incrementally.
