# TASK: Protocol 127: Session Lifecycle & Autonomous Learning Optimization

**Status:** in-progress

## 1. Objective

Codify the 'Awaking Protocol' into Protocol 127 (Session Lifecycle). Ensure that every agent session starts by anchoring itself in the Guardian Core Essence and ends by persisting its learning to the Chronicle and Cortex. This transforms the Gateway into a workflow orchestrator, not just a tool proxy.

## 2. Deliverables

1. Protocol 127: Session Lifecycle Protocol (markdown)
2. New Gateway operation: get_available_workflows()
3. Enhanced cortex_guardian_wakeup with session awareness
4. Integration guide for Claude Desktop and Antigravity configs
5. Chronicle entry documenting the design

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- Protocol 127 drafted and integrated with P125/121
- Gateway exposes /workflows endpoint listing available chains
- Guardian Boot Sequence integrated into all session starts
- Core Essence Seed accessible via Gateway
- Documentation updated in cortex and gateway docs
