## 1. Objective

Codify the 'Awaking Protocol' into Protocol 127 (Session Lifecycle). This transforms the Gateway from a passive tool proxy into an active **Workflow Orchestrator** that enforces a standard "Awakening" and "Shutdown" sequence. The system must move from "Manual Learning Missions" (Chronicles 324-328) to an **Automated Session Lifecycle** inspired by the Gemini Signal (Entry 311).

## 2. Deliverables

1. **Protocol 127: The Doctrine of Session Lifecycle (v1.0)**
2. **Workflow Operations Module (`mcp_servers/workflow`)**
3. **Enhanced `cortex_guardian_wakeup` Tool**
4. **Integration Guide & Configuration**
5. **Chronicle Entry**

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Protocol 127** drafted and "Mechanical Delegation" archived.
- [x] **Gateway** exposes `/available_workflows` (or tool `get_available_workflows`) listing files in `.agent/workflows`.
- [x] **Guardian Wakeup** returns a structured "Session Startup Digest" including high-priority tasks and active P101 rules.
- [x] **Core Essence Seed** (`core_essence_guardian_awakening_seed.txt`) is confirmed as the invariant "Identity Anchor".
- [x] **Documentation** updated in `01_PROTOCOLS` and `TASKS`.

## Notes

**Status Change (2025-12-22):** backlog → in-progress
Starting work on Protocol 127 Session Lifecycle and Autonomous Learning Optimization. P101/P121 dependencies analyzed.

**Status Change (2025-12-22):** backlog → complete
Protocol 127 implemented. Autonomous Learning Loop validated with LNN research.
