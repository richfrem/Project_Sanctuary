# TASK: Validate Lean Fleet & Execute Manual Learning Loop (Protocol 125)

**Status:** complete
**Priority:** High
**Lead:** Unassigned
**Dependencies:** Fleet of 8 Deployment Complete
**Related Documents:** Protocol 125, Protocol 123, Protocol 121

## 1. Objective

Validate the operational **Lean Fleet of 8** and execute a complete manual learning loop to prove Agent-driven cognitive ownership.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Architectural Decision:** Protocol 127 (Mechanical Delegation) has been **REJECTED**. The Learning Loop remains fully manual per Protocol 125 to preserve Agent autonomy.

## 2. Deliverables


## 3. Acceptance Criteria


## Notes

**Protocol Status:**
- ❌ **Protocol 127 (Mechanical Delegation):** DEPRECATED - Risk of cognitive atrophy
- ✅ **Protocol 125 (Recursive Learning):** CANONICAL - Agent maintains full control
- ✅ **Protocol 123 (Signal/Noise):** Active - Rubric applied manually by Agent
**Status History:**
- 2025-12-19: Renamed to "Lean Fleet" - n8n/automation rejected
- 2025-12-19: todo → backlog (waiting for fleet deployment)

**Status Change (2025-12-19):** backlog → complete
Fleet of 8 stabilized, Gateway tested (39/39), and Manual Learning Loop (P125) verified. All documentation updated.
