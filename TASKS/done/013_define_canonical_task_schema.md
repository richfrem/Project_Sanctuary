## 1. Objective

To formally define and document the canonical schema for all Sanctuary task files. This schema will standardize task structure, ensure consistency across all work items, and provide clear guidance for task creation and management.

## 2. Deliverables

1. A new schema document is created at `TASKS/task_schema.md` that formally defines all required fields and sections.
2. The schema includes field definitions, validation rules, and examples for each component.
3. Protocol 115 is updated to reference the canonical schema document.
4. All existing tasks are verified to conform to the schema.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- The file `TASKS/task_schema.md` exists and contains complete schema documentation.
- The schema covers all observed patterns from existing task files.
- Protocol 115 references the schema document.
- Schema includes validation rules and examples for each field.
