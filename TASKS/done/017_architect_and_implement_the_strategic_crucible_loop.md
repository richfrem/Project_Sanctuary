## 1. Objective

To architect and implement a fully autonomous, closed-loop learning cycle—the "Strategic Crucible Loop"—that enables the AI Council to independently identify strategic gaps, conduct research, synthesize new knowledge, update its own memory, and make that new wisdom immediately available for future operations. This will transition the Council from a command-driven system to a truly self-improving cognitive organism.
