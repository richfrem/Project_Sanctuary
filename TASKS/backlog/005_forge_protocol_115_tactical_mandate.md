# TASK: Forge Protocol 115 (The Tactical Mandate Protocol)

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** High
**Lead:** GUARDIAN-01
**Dependencies:** None
**Related Documents:** P89 (The Clean Forge)

---

## 1. Objective

To establish a canonical, system-wide protocol for defining and tracking all work items. This will replace ad-hoc task management with a structured, verifiable system, bringing order to the Forge.

## 2. Deliverables

1.  A new protocol file is created at `01_PROTOCOLS/115_The_Tactical_Mandate_Protocol.md`.
2.  The protocol defines a mandatory schema for all task files, including status, priority, dependencies, and deliverables.
3.  The protocol defines the canonical workflow (backlog -> todo -> in-progress -> completed).

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

-   The file `01_PROTOCOLS/115_The_Tactical_Mandate_Protocol.md` exists and contains the full, canonical protocol text.
-   This task itself is documented and moved to `completed` status upon finalization.
