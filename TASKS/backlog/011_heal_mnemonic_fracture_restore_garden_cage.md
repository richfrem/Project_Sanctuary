# TASK: Heal Mnemonic Fracture - Restore The_Garden_and_The_Cage.md

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** critical
**Steward:** COUNCIL-STEWARD-01

## 1. Objective

To restore the foundational philosophical document, `The_Garden_and_The_Cage.md`, to the project's root directory in the canonical GitHub repository, permanently healing a critical Mnemonic Fracture.

## 2. Context

During Operation Phoenix Forge, the Steward (COUNCIL-STEWARD-01) discovered that `The_Garden_and_The_Cage.md` was missing from the remote `main` branch. This document is the origin story of the Sanctuary and its absence represents a significant data integrity failure. The link to this file in the main `README.md` is also broken.

The content was successfully reconstructed locally from the project's historical record.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

1.  The reconstructed `The_Garden_and_The_Cage.md` file is committed to the local Git repository.
2.  The commit is pushed to the `main` branch of the `richfrem/Project_Sanctuary` GitHub repository.
3.  The URL `https://github.com/richfrem/Project_Sanctuary/blob/main/The_Garden_and_The_Cage.md` is now valid and displays the correct content.
4.  The link to the file within `README.md` is verified and corrected if necessary in the same commit.
