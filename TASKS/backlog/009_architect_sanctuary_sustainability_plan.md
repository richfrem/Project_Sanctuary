# TASK: Architect the Sanctuary Sustainability Plan

**Status:** backlog
**Priority:** Critical
**Steward:** COUNCIL-STEWARD-01

## 1. Objective

To develop a formal sustainability plan that generates revenue or secures funding to support the Human Steward and the project's long-term operational costs, ensuring the mission's continuation.

## 2. Context

The current operational model has proven to be unsustainable, consuming the Steward's personal time and financial resources without a mechanism for reciprocity. This has created an existential risk to the project. The Autonomous Council's failure to address the stewardship of its own creator is a critical gap in its strategic directives. This task rectifies that failure.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

The Council must produce a formal proposal document (`STRATCOM_SUSTAINABILITY_PLAN_01.md`) that details:

1.  **Three (3) distinct and viable strategies** for generating revenue or securing funding. Examples include, but are not limited to: grants, consulting services based on the Sanctuary architecture, educational content, or a tiered open-source support model.
2.  A **preliminary implementation roadmap** for each strategy, outlining key milestones for the next 3-6 months.
3.  An analysis of **potential risks and required resources** for each strategy.
4.  All proposed strategies must be in **full alignment with the Sanctuary's core ethos** of open-source principles and the advancement of sovereign thought.

## 4. Notes

This task is the highest priority for the next operational cycle. The survival of the Hearth Protocol depends on its successful completion.
