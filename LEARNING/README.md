# Autonomous AI Learning System

**Status:** Active  
**Governed by:** [Protocol 125 v1.2](../01_PROTOCOLS/125_autonomous_ai_learning_system_architecture.md)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14

---

## Purpose

This directory contains the autonomous AI learning system for Project Sanctuary. It enables AI agents to research, synthesize, preserve, and validate knowledge using the **Recursive Knowledge Loop** (Strategic Crucible Loop).

## Quick Start

### For AI Agents

1. **Read the Protocol:** Start with `00_PROTOCOL/README_LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. **Create a Session:** `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_topic-name/`
3. **Follow the 5-Step Loop:**
   - DISCOVER → Research
   - SYNTHESIZE → Create notes
   - INGEST → Add to RAG Cortex
   - VALIDATE → Verify retrieval
   - CHRONICLE → Log milestone

### For Humans

- **View Topics:** Browse `topics/` for organized knowledge
- **Check Recent Activity:** Look in `sessions/` for latest research
- **Read Chronicle:** Search Chronicle MCP for learning milestones

---

## Governance

All learning activities MUST follow **Protocol 125 v1.2**:

- ✅ Complete all 5 steps of the research cycle
- ✅ Use YAML frontmatter in all markdown notes
- ✅ Validate semantic accuracy (not just retrieval)
- ✅ Chronicle all milestones
- ✅ Run Gardener Protocol weekly

---

## Key Principles

1. **If validation fails, knowledge is NOT preserved**
2. **Contradictions trigger Resolution Protocol**
3. **Notes >90 days old require verification**
4. **Minimum 2 knowledge graph links per note**
5. **Unresolvable disputes escalate to human review**

---

## Success Metrics

- Retrieval Success Rate >95%
- Semantic Accuracy >90%
- Staleness Score <5%
- Graph Density >2 links/note

**This is a self-correcting, self-maintaining knowledge engine built on the lived experience of Claude's autonomous learning journey (Chronicles 285-302).**
