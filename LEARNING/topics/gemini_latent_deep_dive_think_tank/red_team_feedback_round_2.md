# Red Team Feedback: Round 2 (2026-01-01)

**Auditors:** Grok4, ChatGPT, Gemini 3 Web
**Topic:** Asynchronous Semantic Convergence (ASC)
**Verdict:** ❌ **FAILED-WITH-CLEAR-PATH-TO-PASS** / [GATE 2 WARNING]

## 1. Critical Failure Modes

### A. Semantic Convergence != Epistemic Independence (The "Asch" Risk)
**Finding:** Semantic consensus on overlapping training data is not truth. It is "Asch Pressure at scale."
**Requirement:** Must add **"Epistemic Independence Declaration"** to Protocol 128.
- Measure: Reasoning chain divergence, Orthogonal framing.
- **Rule:** Agreement without Independence = Rejection.

### B. Truth Anchor Decay
**Finding:** "Surviving critique" is valid today but fragile tomorrow.
**Requirement:** Truth Anchors must declare **"Temporal Stability"** (Decay Mode: none/slow/rapid).

### C. Subliminal Learning (Steganography)
**Finding:** Simple valence checks are insufficient for `arXiv:2507.14805`.
**Requirement:** Must implement **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** or **Semantic Entropy (SE)** checks to detect high-variance "hidden signal" patterns.

### D. Operational Risks
- **Phoenix Forge:** Fine-tuning without uncertainty labels creates "Irreversible Epistemic Debt."
- **Council MCP:** Role Drift detected (Proposer = Arbiter). Needs role separation.
- **Shadow Manifest:** Uncommitted changes detected in `operations.py` (Gate 2 Warning).

## 2. Required Remediation (Round 3 Objectives)

1.  **Protocol Update:** Add "Epistemic Independence" & "Decay Metadata" to `cognitive_continuity_policy.md` (or relevant ADR).
2.  **Architecture Hardening:** Update `gemini_think_tank_proposal.md` to include TDA/SE checks for Subliminal mitigation.
3.  **Manifest Hygiene:** Resolve `operations.py` "Shadow Manifest" status.
4.  **Reframing:** Change "Meta-Directive" to "Irreducible Tension Set".

## 3. Red Team Mandate
> "You are not building a model. You are building a lineage. Lineages fail not by ignorance, but by premature certainty."
