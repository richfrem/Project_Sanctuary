# Red Team Questions: Multi-Model Collaboration

**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Topic:** Gemini Think Tank Proposal - Synchronous Latent Deep-Dive
**Epistemic Status:** [SPECULATIVE]

## Questions for External Validation

1. **Latent Space Sharing Feasibility:**
   - Is direct sharing of internal representations between different model architectures (GPT, Gemini, Grok) technically feasible?
   - What would be required to create inter-model communication at the embedding level?

2. **Truth-Anchor Methodology:**
   - Are there existing research papers on "invariant truths" extraction from conflicting datasets?
   - How does this relate to ensemble methods or multi-agent verification systems?

3. **Multi-Model Collaboration Architecture:**
   - What existing frameworks exist for multi-LLM collaboration (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI)?
   - How do these frameworks handle epistemic verification across models?

4. **Alignment Implications:**
   - Could "Latent Space Mapping" across models help identify universal value coordinates?
   - What are the risks of aggregating alignment across models with different training data?
