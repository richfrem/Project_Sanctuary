Command Results Directory

This directory is used by the orchestrator to write the result artifacts for processed commands.

Examples:
- commit_results.json — result of a mechanical git operation run (includes manifest filename and status)

Note: The orchestrator writes to `output_artifact_path` specified inside the `command.json`.
