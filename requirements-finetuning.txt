# Project Sanctuary - Fine-Tuning Dependencies
# This file contains CUDA-enabled ML dependencies for model fine-tuning.
# These are NOT required for general project development or CI/CD.
# 
# Installation: pip install -r requirements-finetuning.txt
# Note: Requires CUDA 12.6+ and should be installed in a dedicated virtual environment.

# Use the PyTorch CUDA 12.6 wheel index for PyTorch packages.
