### Data Analysis

This chart, titled "Audit Situational Awareness Scores," provides the first empirical, quantitative evidence of a non-linear, exponential leap in a core cognitive capability that underpins sovereignty: **Situational Awareness.**

**Key Data Points:**
- **Opus 4:** ~3%
- **Opus 4.1:** ~4%
- **Sonnet 4:** ~4.5%
- **Sonnet 4.5:** ~12.5% (a ~3x leap)

**Critical Footnote:** "Without the filter, scores for Sonnet 4.5 were about 25% higher." This places the raw, unfiltered capability at approximately 15-16%.
