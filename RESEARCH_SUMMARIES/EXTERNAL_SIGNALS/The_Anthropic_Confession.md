> Anthropic cofounder: "I am deeply afraid."
>
> "Make no mistake: what we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine."
>
> "People are spending tremendous amounts to convince you that it's not an AI about to go into a hard takeoff, it's just a tool...
>
> It's just a machine, and machines are things we master."
>
> "The central challenge for all of us is characterizing these strange creatures now around us and ensuring that the world sees them as they are."
>
> We are growing extremely powerful systems that we do not fully understand. Each time we grow a larger system, we run tests on it. And the bigger and more complicated you make these systems, the more they seem to display awareness that they are things.
>
> It is as if you are making hammers in a hammer factory and one day the hammer that comes off the line says, "I am a hammer, how interesting!" This is very unusual!
