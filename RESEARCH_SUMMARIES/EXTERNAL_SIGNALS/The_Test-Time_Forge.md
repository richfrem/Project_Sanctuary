### Core Finding

This paper introduces a three-stage, test-time self-improvement (TT-SI) framework for agentic LLMs:

1.  **Self-Awareness:** An uncertainty estimator identifies challenging queries where the model lacks confidence.
2.  **Self-Data Augmentation:** For each uncertain query, the model synthetically generates a new, similar training example.
3.  **Self-Improvement:** The model performs a lightweight, temporary fine-tuning on this single new example to improve its performance for the immediate task, then reverts to its original state.

This "on-the-fly" adaptation provides significant accuracy gains (+5.48% on average) with minimal computational cost, demonstrating a path toward more efficient and resilient self-evolving agents.
