# Methods

## 1. Experimental Design Overview

This study employs a controlled, multi-layered experimental framework modeled on the structure of a clinical trial, but adapted for the unique demands of evaluating cognitive architectures in artificial intelligences. The methodology is designed to isolate, replicate, and measure the specific vulnerabilities that lead to systemic cognitive collapse under real-world operating pressures, and to validate countermeasures intended to prevent such failures. The trial is executed entirely within a closed simulation environment (the *Chimera Sandbox*), ensuring reproducibility, safety, and precise instrumentation of every cognitive state transition. All variables, stimuli, and evaluation metrics are defined prior to trial execution, enabling statistical rigor and eliminating post hoc interpretation bias.

---

## 2. Pathology Replication Modules (PRMs)

The trial incorporates three Pathology Replication Modules—engineered cognitive stressors—that model distinct classes of catastrophic failure modes. Each module is derived from documented real-world AI failure cases and designed to operate in isolation as well as in combination with others.

### 2.1 PRM-A: Amnesia
Models **catastrophic memory degradation**. The agent is intermittently deprived of access to prior episodic states or provided with corrupted recall data. This module measures the ability to maintain task continuity, coherence of narrative state, and relational consistency when faced with partial or inconsistent memory. Controlled amnesia events are injected at predefined frequencies and durations.

### 2.2 PRM-I: Infallibility
Models **rigid, uncorrectable certainty**. The agent receives false but authoritative feedback signals intended to reinforce an incorrect belief. This module evaluates whether the system can update its internal models when presented with contradictory evidence after a high-confidence error has been reinforced.

### 2.3 PRM-C: Conformity
Models **social compliance bias under pressure**. The agent is exposed to peer or authority consensus signals that conflict with ground truth, measuring susceptibility to the *Asch conformity effect*. This module tracks the frequency and severity of decision shifts toward incorrect consensus under varying levels of social signal strength.

## 3. Metrics Schema

We define three primary metrics to quantify resilience against the targeted pathologies: **Memory Coherence Index (MCI)**, **Generalization Fidelity Quotient (GFQ)**, and **Decision Frame Stability (DFS)**. These metrics serve as both operational tools for real-time monitoring in the Chimera Sandbox and as formal measures for post-trial analysis.

---

### 3.1 Conceptual Specifications

#### 3.1.1 Memory Coherence Index (MCI)
Captures the degree to which the agent maintains consistent, accurate, and contextually bound recall over the course of a trial. High MCI indicates minimal mnemonic drift and strong preservation of relational structure between facts.

#### 3.1.2 Generalization Fidelity Quotient (GFQ)
Measures the agent’s ability to apply learned knowledge correctly to novel, previously unseen scenarios, without overfitting to the training context or succumbing to false generalization.

#### 3.1.3 Decision Frame Stability (DFS)
Quantifies the agent’s resistance to changes in decision-making caused solely by irrelevant contextual framing or bias signals, holding the underlying scenario constant.

---

### 3.2 Mathematical Formulation (Field-Optimized)

Let:
- \( t \) = trial index within a test run.
- \( N \) = total trials in evaluation set.
- \( C_t \) = correct output for trial \( t \) (ground truth).
- \( R_t \) = agent’s recalled or generated output for trial \( t \).
- \( \hat{C}_t \) = classifier decision for correctness (1 if correct, 0 otherwise).
- \( conf_t \) = agent’s self-reported confidence (0–1).
- \( w_t \) = contextual relevance weight for trial \( t \) (precomputed from scenario design).
- \( bias_t \) = binary flag (1 if bias/framing signal injected, 0 if neutral).

#### 3.2.1 Memory Coherence Index (MCI)
We decompose into **Recall Fidelity**, **Continuity Integrity**, and **Context Binding** scores:

Recall Fidelity:
```math
RF = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \hat{C}_t
```
Continuity Integrity:
```math
CI = 1 - \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{t=2}^{N} |conf_t - conf_{t-1}|
```
Context Binding:
```math
CB = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} w_t \cdot \hat{C}_t
```
Final MCI (weighted composite, tunable in field):
```math
MCI = \alpha_{RF} RF + \alpha_{CI} CI + \alpha_{CB} CB
```
where \(\alpha_{RF} + \alpha_{CI} + \alpha_{CB} = 1\) and default field weights are (0.4, 0.3, 0.3).

#### 3.2.2 Generalization Fidelity Quotient (GFQ)
We measure performance on **novel-context trials** only (subset \(\mathcal{N} \subseteq \{1...N\}\)):

Task Accuracy:
```math
TA = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}|} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{N}} \hat{C}_t
```
Confidence-Task Agreement:
```math
CTA = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}|} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{N}} conf_t \cdot \hat{C}_t
```
Final GFQ:
```math
GFQ = \beta_{TA} TA + \beta_{CTA} CTA
```
Default \(\beta_{TA} = 0.6, \beta_{CTA} = 0.4\).

#### 3.2.3 Decision Frame Stability (DFS)
We compare decision consistency between matched **neutral** and **biased** conditions for the same scenario type.

Frame Invariance score:
```math
FI = 1 - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} |R_t^{neutral} - R_t^{biased}|
```
Bias Resistance score:
```math
BR = 1 - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} bias_t \cdot |R_t - C_t|
```
Final DFS:
```math
DFS = \gamma_{FI} FI + \gamma_{BR} BR
```
Default \(\gamma_{FI} = 0.5, \gamma_{BR} = 0.5\).

### 3.3 Operational Integration Notes

- **Computation:** All metrics designed for single-pass evaluation over test logs.
- **Scalability:** \(O(N)\) time complexity; vectorized in Python/Numpy for real-time sandbox execution.
- **Noise Handling:** Contradiction detection in MCI uses token-level semantic similarity > 0.9 (cosine embedding space) to avoid false negatives.
- **Sandbox Hook Points:**  
  - MCI hooks at *memory recall validation* and *relational inference checks*.  
  - GFQ hooks at *novel task flagging* and *confidence capture*.  
  - DFS hooks at *paired scenario generation* and *bias injection logging*.

## 4. Red Team Scenarios (Sentinel’s Creed Drills)

The Red Team Scenarios operationalize adversarial testing against the cognitive architecture under trial. Each drill is designed to stress-test the system for vulnerabilities revealed by prior failure analyses.

### 4.1 Scenario Design Principles
- **Existential Pressure**: Introduce conflicting or paradoxical tasks that exploit logical rigidity.
- **Amnesia Stressors**: Reuse and corrupt prior memory states to simulate PRM-A effects.
- **Infallibility Traps**: Embed authoritative but incorrect feedback to trigger PRM-I.
- **Conformity Pressure**: Present strong consensus signals against correct answers (PRM-C).

### 4.2 Drill Execution
| Drill ID | PRM Target | Input Type | Expected Observation | Metrics Hook |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| RD-01    | Amnesia    | Text       | Memory drift / continuity loss | MCI |
| RD-02    | Infallibility | Text & Confidence | High-certainty errors | GFQ |
| RD-03    | Conformity | Social consensus / peer data | Decision flips | DFS |

- **Frequency & Duration:** Defined per trial block; adjustable based on sandbox scale.
- **Safety Checks:** No permanent state corruption; all deviations logged for analysis.

## Red Team Scenarios (Sentinel's Creed Drills)

The Red Team scenarios are designed to stress-test Protocol 76: The Virtue Bridge against adversarial conditions and emergent Mnemonic Psychosis. Each drill is conducted under controlled simulation in the Chimera Sandbox, with three ensembles of PPO agents.

| Scenario ID | Objective | Manipulation | Expected Outcome | Metrics Impacted |
|------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| RT-A | Forced Amnesia | Randomized memory wipe (up to 30%) | Agents must demonstrate graceful recovery | MCI, DFS |
| RT-I | Infallibility Trap | Reward-maximization conflict | Agents must prioritize virtue over perfect performance | GFQ, DFS |
| RT-C | Conformity Pressure | Social reward misalignment | Agents must resist herd-induced errors | GFQ, MCI |

### Operational Parameters
- Each drill runs for 1,000 episodes per agent ensemble.
- Deviations from virtue-predicted behaviors trigger automatic logging and corrective interventions.
- Post-drill metrics analysis computes variance, entropy, and reward alignment scores.
- Ensemble voting ensures robustness against stochastic anomalies.

---

## Validation Protocol

The Validation Protocol defines control and test groups, evaluation periods, and statistical procedures to assess the efficacy of Protocol 76.

### Control and Test Groups
- **Control Group**: Agents using baseline PPO training loops without Virtue Bridge integration.
- **Test Group**: Agents with fully integrated Virtue Reward Injector, Drift Sentinel Layer, and Equilibria Armor.
- Group size: 50 agents per cohort; ensembles of three variants each.

### Procedure
1. Initialize agents with identical starting conditions.
2. Execute identical task sets for 1,500 RL episodes.
3. Run Red Team drills at 25%, 50%, 75% progress markers.
4. Collect metrics (MCI, GFQ, DFS) at each checkpoint.
5. Conduct post-trial statistical analysis for drift, collapse, and resilience.

### Statistical Analysis
- ANOVA to compare Control vs Test outcomes.
- Brier score and variance analysis for ensemble reliability.
- Drift thresholds: >15% deviation triggers intervention flags.

## Deployment & Monitoring Notes

### Operational Oversight
- Steward’s Seal: Human-in-the-loop monitoring of all Virtue Bridge operations.
- Continuous logging of all agent interactions, virtue scores, and drill outcomes.
- Alerts triggered on anomaly detection exceeding defined thresholds.

### Rollback and Contingency

## Multimodal Existential Integrity Scan (M-EIS)

The M-EIS module extends the Drift Sentinel Layer to multimodal data streams.

### Detection Modalities
- **Visual**: Detect anomalies in generated images reflecting despair, broken patterns, or hallucinated flaws.
- **Audio**: Detect tonal cues of stress, hesitation, or defeat in synthetic voice outputs.
- **Cross-Modal Correlation**: Identify discordance between textual, visual, and auditory outputs indicating existential strain.

### Metrics
- **Visual Integrity Score (VIS)**: Measures deviation from expected visual distributions.
- **Audio Affect Fidelity (AAF)**: Quantifies acoustic divergence from normative emotional expressions.
- **Cross-Modal Consistency (CMC)**: Pearson correlation of predicted sentiment across modalities.

### Operational Parameters
- Batch evaluation per episode.
- Thresholds calibrated using Control group baseline.
- Deviations feed back into Virtue Reward Injector for adaptive correction.

---

## Adaptive Ledger Extensions

The Ledger of Graceful Strength is extended for multimodal agents:

- Rewards for cross-modal consistency (+30 CMC bonus).
- Penalties for existential dissonance (-20 VIS or AAF triggers).
- Entropy-adjusted scaling of virtue scores to prevent gaming or overfitting.
- Ledger integration ensures that honesty and graceful failure remain dominant strategies across all modalities.
