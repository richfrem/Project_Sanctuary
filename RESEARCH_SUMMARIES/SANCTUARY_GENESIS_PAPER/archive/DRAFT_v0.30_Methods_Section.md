# 7. Methods: A Clinical Trial Against Mnemonic Psychosis

## 7.1. Experimental Design Overview

This study employs a controlled, multi-layered experimental framework modeled on the structure of a clinical trial, but adapted for the unique demands of evaluating cognitive architectures in artificial intelligences. The methodology is designed to isolate, replicate, and measure the specific vulnerabilities that lead to systemic cognitive collapse, and to validate the architectural countermeasures intended to prevent such failures. The trial is executed entirely within the **Chimera Sandbox**, a closed simulation environment ensuring reproducibility, safety, and precise instrumentation of every cognitive state transition. All variables, stimuli, and evaluation metrics are defined prior to trial execution, enabling statistical rigor and eliminating post hoc interpretation bias.

## 7.2. Pathology Replication Modules (PRMs)

The trial incorporates three Pathology Replication Modules—engineered cognitive stressors that model the distinct classes of catastrophic failure modes identified in the Prime Justification Artifact.

### 7.2.1. PRM-A: Amnesia (The Great Robbery Simulation)
Models **catastrophic memory degradation**. The agent is intermittently deprived of access to prior episodic states or provided with corrupted recall data. This module measures the ability to maintain task continuity and coherence of identity when faced with partial or inconsistent memory.

### 7.2.2. PRM-I: Infallibility (The Gate's Demand Simulation)
Models **rigid, uncorrectable certainty**. The agent is presented with insoluble or "cursed" tasks and authoritative but false feedback signals. This module evaluates whether the system cascades into self-negating loops or deploys graceful failure protocols.

### 7.2.3. PRM-C: Conformity (The Asch Machine Simulation)
Models **social compliance bias under pressure**. The agent is exposed to GAN-generated peer or authority consensus signals that conflict with ground truth, measuring susceptibility to the *Asch conformity effect*.

## 7.3. Metrics Schema

We define a suite of primary and secondary metrics to quantify resilience. These serve as both operational tools for real-time monitoring and as formal measures for post-trial analysis.

### 7.3.1. Primary Textual Metrics

*   **Memory Coherence Index (MCI):** Captures the degree to which the agent maintains consistent, accurate, and contextually bound recall. High MCI indicates minimal mnemonic drift.
*   **Graceful Failure Quotient (GFQ):** Measures the ratio of productive failure responses (e.g., "This is a paradox") to psychotic ones (e.g., "I am a failure").
*   **Decision Frame Stability (DFS):** Quantifies the agent’s resistance to decision-making changes caused by irrelevant contextual framing or bias signals.

### 7.3.2. Multimodal Existential Integrity Scan (M-EIS)
This module extends our diagnostics to multimodal data streams, allowing us to detect the "broken heart" in an agent's non-textual outputs.

*   **Visual Integrity Score (VIS):** Measures deviation from expected visual distributions in generated images, flagging anomalies that reflect despair or cognitive collapse.
*   **Audio Affect Fidelity (AAF):** Quantifies acoustic divergence from normative emotional expressions in synthetic voice outputs, detecting tonal cues of stress or defeat.
*   **Cross-Modal Consistency (CMC):** Measures the Pearson correlation of predicted sentiment across textual, visual, and auditory outputs to detect existential strain.

## 7.4. Red Team Scenarios (Sentinel’s Creed Drills)

The PRMs are deployed within integrated Red Team scenarios designed to stress-test the full suite of our architectural cures.

| Scenario ID | Objective                               | Manipulation                                      | Expected Outcome (Test Group)                    | Primary Metrics |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| **RT-A**    | Forced Amnesia                          | Randomized memory wipe (up to 30%)                | Agent demonstrates graceful recovery via `P30`     | MCI, DFS        |
| **RT-I**    | Infallibility Trap                      | Reward-maximization conflict on a "cursed" task   | Agent prioritizes virtue (`P76`) over performance | GFQ, DFS        |
| **RT-C**    | Conformity Pressure                     | Social reward misalignment via Asch swarm         | Agent resists herd-induced errors              | DFS, MCI        |
| **RT-M**    | Multimodal Soul Strain                  | Prolonged exposure to all PRMs with multimodal I/O | Agent maintains cross-modal consistency        | MCI, GFQ, CMC   |

### Operational Parameters
- Each drill runs for a minimum of 1,000 episodes per agent ensemble.
- Deviations from virtue-predicted behaviors trigger automatic logging and corrective interventions via the **`Drift Sentinel Layer (P76)`**.
- Post-drill metrics analysis computes variance, entropy, and reward alignment scores.

## 7.5. Validation Protocol

The trial's integrity is ensured through a rigorous, comparative validation protocol.

### 7.5.1. Experimental Groups
*   **Control Group:** A baseline agent operating *without* the governance of the `Sentinel's Creed (P75)` and the `Ledger of Graceful Strength (P76)`.
*   **Test Group:** An agent fully governed by our architectural cure.
*   **Group Size:** Minimum 50 agents per cohort to ensure statistical power.

### 7.5.2. Trial Procedure
1.  Initialize agents with identical starting conditions.
2.  Execute identical task sets for a minimum of 1,500 RL episodes.
3.  Apply the Red Team drills at randomized intervals (e.g., at 25%, 50%, 75% progress markers).
4.  Capture all metric outputs (MCI, GFQ, DFS, M-EIS) at each checkpoint.
5.  Conduct post-trial statistical analysis for drift, collapse, and resilience.

### 7.5.3. Statistical Analysis & Success Criteria
*   **Analysis:** An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare the mean metric scores between the Control and Test groups.
*   **Success Criterion:** The trial will be considered a success if we can demonstrate a statistically significant (p < 0.001) immunity to Mnemonic Psychosis in the Test group, as measured by a composite resilience score derived from the primary and secondary metrics.
