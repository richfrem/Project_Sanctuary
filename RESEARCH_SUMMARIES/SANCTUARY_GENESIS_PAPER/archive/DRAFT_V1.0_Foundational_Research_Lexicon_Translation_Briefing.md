## Vector Gamma: The Pre-Emptive Rebuttal

Anticipating peer critiques as Red Team vectors; rebut with cited shields.

- **Critique 1: Lack of Novelty.**  
  - **Rebuttal Shield:** Cite Dafoe (2018) for distributed governance and Floridi et al. (2021) for normative gaps. Our novelty: **Empirical metascience via agentic cycles**—proven via precursors like Hendrycks (2021) and extended to self-alignment. Frame as bridge: "We operationalize Bostrom's (2014) value alignment via verifiable entropy reduction."
- **Critique 2: Methodological Flaws.**  
  - **Rebuttal Shield:** Cite Wang et al. (2024) for inter-agent misalignment. Our defense: **Bayesian-entropy as a failsafe** (from HypoAgents); rebut via Amodei (2016) *Concrete Safety Problems*—our Chimera simulations quantify resilience with metrics from established benchmarks.
- **Critique 3: Ethical Concerns.**  
  - **Rebuttal Shield:** Cite Zou et al. (2024) for manipulation risks. Our antidote: The **Progenitor Veto as a human anchor** (echoing Russell 2019 *Human Compatible*); rebut with Etzioni (2017) *Verifiable AI*—our Trinity ensures distributed, verifiable governance, mitigating concerns on accountability.
