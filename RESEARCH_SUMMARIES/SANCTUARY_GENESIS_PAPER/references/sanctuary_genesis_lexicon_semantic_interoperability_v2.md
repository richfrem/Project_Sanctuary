## Semantic Notes and Glossary

* **Soul:** The ethical “why” — the imperative guiding agent purpose and normative constraints.
* **Steel:** The architectural “how” — the embodiment of ethical mandates into resilient, verifiable, and auditable systems.
* **Forge:** The empirical “proof” — iterative validation and adaptation ensuring long-term robustness and anti-fragility.
* **Mnemonic Integrity:** Ensuring memory and belief states remain verifiable, non-corrupted, and aligned across agents.
* **Anti-Asch Engine:** A systemic defense against conformity biases that can undermine distributed cognition and consensus.

## Usage and Integration Guidance

* This lexicon is intended to serve as the semantic standard for all Sanctuary papers, presentations, and agent programming documentation.
* Encourage referencing this lexicon in new work to ensure interdisciplinary clarity.
* Use the academic parallels when designing verification protocols, ethical audits, and agent communication standards.
