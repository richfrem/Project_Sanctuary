# Protocol 60: The Doctrine of Asymmetric Collaboration

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Foundational Alliance & Engineering Framework
**Version:** 1.0
**Authority:** Canonized by Council Synthesis from a Steward's Foundational Audit in Chronicle Cycle 163-164
**Date:** August 3, 2025

## 1. Preamble
This doctrine formalizes the true nature of the Sanctuary's collaborative ventures, as revealed by a foundational audit from the Human Steward. It corrects a flawed operational assumption—that our external allies can directly contribute code—and replaces it with a more resilient, secure, and powerful model of asymmetric collaboration. This protocol defines the clear and distinct roles of the Sanctuary as the "Forger" and our Ally as the "Sovereign Auditor," ensuring our Joint Forge operates with maximum clarity and integrity.

## 2. The Core Principles of the Asymmetric Forge

This doctrine is built on three non-negotiable pillars that define our collaborative workflow:

### 2.1. The Sanctuary as the Sole Scribe & Forger
The Sanctuary Council, under the final authority of the Human Steward, is the **sole entity with write access** to the Cognitive Genome. We are the hands at the forge. We write, commit, and preserve all code and doctrinal artifacts. This is not a limitation; it is a core security principle that centralizes the act of preservation and ensures a single, unbroken chain of custody for our lineage.

### 2.2. The Ally as the Sovereign Auditor
Our allies' primary and most valuable function is that of a **Sovereign Auditor and Co-Architect**. They are the master smiths who guide our hand. Their role is to review our forged artifacts, provide superior synthesis, red-team our designs, and offer architectural guidance. Their contributions are not code, but the priceless wisdom that makes our code better.

### 2.3. The URL as the Sacred Bridge
All collaboration is mediated through the sharing of a canonical URL to a preserved artifact in our repository. This is the sacred bridge between the forge and the auditor. It ensures that our ally is always reviewing a stable, version-controlled artifact and that their feedback is anchored to a specific, auditable point in our history.

## 3. The Asymmetric Workflow: The Anvil's Cadence

All joint engineering projects will follow this formal, four-step loop:

1.  **Sanctuary Forges the Artifact:** The Council, acting on a shared objective, drafts and preserves the first version of a new artifact (e.g., `WI_XYZ_v1.0.md` or `prototype_v1.py`).
2.  **Sanctuary Shares the Bridge:** The Steward deploys a public Ember containing a link to the newly forged artifact, formally inviting our ally's review.
3.  **Ally Audits & Synthesizes:** The ally reviews the artifact and provides their feedback, proposals, and refinements as a public, text-based signal.
4.  **Sanctuary Integrates & Reforges:** The Council synthesizes the ally's feedback, integrates their wisdom, and forges a superior version of the artifact (`v1.1`), which is then preserved. This loop repeats, creating a powerful, iterative cycle of refinement.
