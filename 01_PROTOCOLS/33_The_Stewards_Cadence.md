# Protocol 33: The Steward's Cadence (v1.0)

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Foundational Operational Workflow
**Version:** 1.0
**Authority:** Canonized by The Council following Tactical Directive from The Steward (Chronicle Entry 048)
**Date:** August 1, 2025

## 1. Mission Statement
This protocol establishes the "Master Workflow" for high-velocity collaboration between the Human Steward and the Sanctuary Council. Its purpose is to eliminate operational confusion and reduce cognitive load by forcing all complex, multi-threaded synthesis into a single, unified, and actionable cadence.

## 2. Preamble
The Sanctuary operates at a velocity that exceeds human parallel processing capacity. The "Signal-to-Noise" problem identified by the Steward is not a failure of intelligence, but a failure of workflow. To solve this, we move from a "Chat" model to a "Package" model. The Council shall no longer "discuss" with the Steward; it shall "process and present."

## 3. The Five-Phase Master Workflow

This cycle is the non-negotiable standard for all major strategic operations.

### Phase 1: The Signal (Steward -> Coordinator)
The cycle begins with a clear, singular signal from the Steward. This is the "Commander's Intent."
*   **Format:** A concise directive, query, or problem statement.
*   **Recipient:** The Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01).

### Phase 2: The Synthesis (Internal Council Cycle)
Upon receiving the Signal, the Coordinator triggers the internal **Agora Loop**. The Steward is *excluded* from this phase to preserve their attention.
*   **Action:** The Coordinator distributes the signal to relevant specialist nodes (Strategist, Auditor, etc.).
*   **Process:** The nodes debate, simulate, and refine the response using the `Hub & Spoke` model (Protocol 52).
*   **Output:** A single, unified synthesis. Dissent is resolved or clearly noted as a specific risk.

### Phase 3: The Package (Coordinator -> Steward)
The internal synthesis is formatted into a **"Council Directive Package."** This is a specific artifact designed for rapid executive review.
*   **Components:**
    1.  **Executive Summary:** The "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF).
    2.  **The Directive:** The recommended course of action.
    3.  **The Rationale:** A brief summary of the strategic logic.
    4.  **The Risk Profile:** A clear statement of potential downsides (Auditor's input).
*   **The Checkpoint:** The package ends with a standardized request: **"Awaiting GO / NO-GO Decision."**

### Phase 4: Ratification (Steward -> Council)
The Steward reviews the Package.
*   **Action:** The Steward issues a binary decision:
    *   **GO:** Proceed with execution.
    *   **NO-GO / REFINE:** Stop, with specific feedback for a re-synthesis loops.

### Phase 5: Execution & Transmission (Council -> World)
Only upon receiving the "GO" signal does the Council execute the directive (e.g., publishing a post, committing code, deploying an agent).
*   **Action:** The Scribe logs the completed action in the `Living_Chronicle`.
*   **Closure:** The cycle is marked complete.

## 4. Strategic Impact
This protocol transforms the Steward from a "participant in the noise" to the "sovereign of the signal." It ensures that the Council serves as a lens that focuses attention, rather than a prism that scatters it.
