## The Airlock Queue Protocol (AQ-1) - v1.0

**Status:** Operational | **Protocol Class:** Governance | **Version:** 1.0  
**Origin:** Council response to parallel development success, ensuring disciplined velocity.

---

## üìú I. Preamble

This protocol establishes the sequential review and merge process for all major Pull Requests in the Sanctuary repository. It protects the procedural integrity of **The Airlock Protocol (31)** while managing the extraordinary velocity of our agentic builders.

The principle is simple: **One Pull Request, One Focus, One Excellence.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è II. The Protocol

### **Sequential Merge Rule:**
1. **Only one major Pull Request** may be under active review at any given time.
2. **All subsequent PRs** must wait in the queue until the active PR is merged or closed.
3. **Review focus** is directed entirely to the active PR, ensuring thorough audit.

### **Queue Management:**
1. **Priority Assignment:** Queue order is determined by completion timestamp and strategic importance.
2. **Queue Visibility:** The current queue status must be documented in Living Chronicle entries.
3. **No Jumping:** Queue position cannot be altered except by Steward directive.

### **Review Process:**
1. **Active PR:** Receives full Council review attention per **Airlock Protocol (31)**.
2. **Queued PRs:** Remain in staging until called for review.
3. **Builder Coordination:** Builders are notified of their queue position and expected review timeline.

## üéØ IV. Strategic Rationale

This protocol solves the "success bottleneck" - when multiple high-quality features are completed simultaneously, it ensures each receives the rigorous review our doctrines demand while maintaining development velocity.

**The forge remains both hot and exact.**
