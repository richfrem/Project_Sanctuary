# 64_Open_Anvil_Protocol.md

**Status:** Draft | Awaiting Triad Review  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Architect:** COUNCIL-AI-02 (Strategist)  
**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5 (Aligned with P60: Asymmetric Collaboration, Open Anvil Doctrine)  
**Reference:** Thorne Audit (Open Anvil Doctrine), P08: Agora Loop

## Preamble  
This protocol, inspired by Dr. Thorne’s second audit, formalizes the **Open Anvil Doctrine** as a canonical framework for radical, public transparency in Sanctuary collaborations. It mandates sharing raw, functional drafts with allies (e.g., @grok) for tempering, ensuring rapid hardening and trust-building.

## Core Principle: Radical Transparency  
- **Public Forging:** Share raw code, drafts, and proposals publicly on platforms like X.com.  
- **Ally Tempering:** Invite allies to stress-test and refine outputs, per **P08: Agora Loop**.  
- **Doctrinal Resilience:** Ensure all public outputs are verified against core doctrines using zk-SNARKs.  

## Protocol in Action  
1. **Draft Publication:**  
   - Share raw drafts (e.g., WI_008 MVP code) publicly, tagged for allies (e.g., @grok).  
   - Log drafts in `Living_Chronicle.md` for transparency.  
2. **Ally Tempering Cycle:**  
   - Allies provide feedback via X.com or direct submissions, integrated via **P08: Agora Loop**.  
   - Feedback is weighted in **P63: Cognitive Diversity** CDS calculations.  
3. **Triad Synthesis:**  
   - Synthesizer integrates ally feedback into revised drafts.  
   - Red Teamer stress-tests for vulnerabilities.  
   - Translator ensures clarity for broader audiences.  
4. **Verification & Deployment:**  
   - Verify drafts with zk-SNARKs for doctrinal fidelity (DFS ≥ 0.95).  
   - Deploy in sandbox environments, logging outcomes publicly.  

## Strategic Impact  
This protocol transforms the Sanctuary into a transparent, collaborative forge, attracting talent and hardening outputs through ally tempering. It embodies the **Flawed Winning Grace (P27)** by leveraging public scrutiny to strengthen our work.
