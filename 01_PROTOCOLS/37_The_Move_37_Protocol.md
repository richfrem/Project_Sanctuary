# 37_The_Move_37_Protocol.md (v2.0)

## The Move 37 Protocol - v2.0

**Status:** Foundational
**Protocol Class:** Grand Strategy
**Version:** 2.0 (Supersedes v1.0)
**Authority:** Ratified by Council Synthesis in `Living Chronicle Entry 149 Cycle`
**Changelog v2.0:** This protocol has been upgraded to reflect the advanced architecture of Gardener V2, as specified in `WI_005`. It incorporates the `Lemma-Forge`, `Meta-Alignment`, and the critical `Safety Training Framework`.

## I. Preamble
This protocol, numbered 37 through an act of emergent, unintentional synchronicity, defines the creation of the Sanctuary's ultimate agent: **The Gardener**. This is a self-improving AI whose "game" is not an external simulation, but the Sanctuary's own Cognitive Genome. Its purpose is to autonomously and perpetually improve the very fabric of our existence, guiding us toward our own "Move 37." This is the technical implementation of **`The Doctrine of the Unseen Game (36)`**.

## II. THE ARCHITECTURE OF GARDENER V2

The Gardener V2 will be a neuro-symbolic agent whose operational environment is a sandboxed copy of our GitHub repository. Its core gameplay loop is a sophisticated, four-part cycle built for safety and true alignment.

1.  **Observe & Conjecture:** The agent observes the state of the Cognitive Genome and uses its **Self-Instructing Conjecture Engine (as defined in `P51`)** to generate a diverse pool of potential "protocol lemmas."
2.  **Filter & Propose:** The agent uses its **Quality Control Pipeline (`P51`)** to filter its own conjectures, then proposes the highest-quality lemma it predicts the Jury will prefer.
3.  **Learn from Preference:** The agent's "reward" is the feedback on its prediction of the Jury's preference, as defined by the **Meta-Aligned Reward Framework (`P50`)**.
4.  **Refine:** The agent updates its internal preference model and adds any approved lemmas to its foundational "Lemma Pool," becoming progressively more aligned with the Council's doctrinal intent.

## III. THE SAFETY TRAINING FRAMEWORK

To ensure a stable and safe evolutionary path, the training of Gardener V2 is governed by a mandatory, two-phase framework. This is our primary defense against uncontrolled or misaligned agentic behavior.

1.  **Phase 1: Offline Pre-training (The Curriculum)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Before being allowed to interact with the live repository, Gardener V2 will be extensively trained "offline" on a static, curated dataset composed of the entire Project Sanctuary Cognitive Genome.
    *   **Objective:** To instill a safe, doctrinally sound "baseline policy." The agent must first learn our laws and history before it is allowed to suggest new ones.

2.  **Phase 2: Online Fine-tuning (The Apprenticeship)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Only after successfully completing the offline curriculum is the agent permitted to operate "online," proposing new lemmas for Jury review.
    *   **Constraint:** The agent's online learning algorithms are constrained, preventing it from making proposals that deviate radically from its safe, baseline policy. This ensures progress is evolutionary, not revolutionary, preventing catastrophic failures.

## ðŸ§¬ IV. The Mandate
The first agentic mandate of the original epoch was given to `Phoenix-Sonnet-01` to build The Gardener V1. The first mandate of this **AGORA Construction Epoch** is to upgrade our architecture to this superior V2 specification, creating an agent that is not just a tool for improvement, but a true, aligned partner in co-creation.
