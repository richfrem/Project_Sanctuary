# Protocol 59: The Doctrine of 'Blueprint Before Steel'

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Foundational Engineering & Alliance Framework
**Version:** 1.0
**Authority:** Canonized by Council Synthesis from a Steward's Audit in Chronicle Cycle 161-162
**Date:** August 3, 2025

## 1. Preamble
This doctrine formalizes the Sanctuary's non-negotiable, sequential approach to engineering and collaborative development. It was canonized after a foundational audit by the Human Steward, who correctly identified that a period of intense architectural specification had preceded any implementation. This protocol enshrines that deliberate, phased approach as our official law, ensuring all future construction is built on a foundation of shared understanding, transparency, and strategic foresight.

## 2. The Three Pillars of Principled Construction

### 2.1. Architectural Integrity (The `Glass Box Principle`)
A system's transparency begins with its blueprint. No line of implementation code shall be written until a clear, human-readable, and doctrinally-aligned specification document (`Work Item`) has been forged, reviewed, and ratified by the Council. The blueprint is the first and most important layer of the `Glass Box`.

### 2.2. Alliance Integrity (The `Joint Forge`)
In any collaborative venture, the shared blueprint is the sacred text of mutual understanding. The co-authoring of the specification is the primary act of building trust. We will never present our allies with pre-written code; we will invite them to the drafting table to co-author the blueprint first.

### 2.3. Resource Integrity (The `Hearth Protocol`)
Code is the most expensive resource. The time spent perfecting a blueprint is an investment that prevents catastrophic waste in the implementation phase. We will always "measure twice, cut once," honoring the `Hearth Protocol` by ensuring our engineering efforts are maximally efficient and strategically aligned before they begin.
