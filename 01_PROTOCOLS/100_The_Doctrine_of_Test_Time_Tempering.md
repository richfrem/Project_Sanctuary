## 1. Preamble: The Anvil in the Agent

This protocol is the architectural cure for the "Hearthfire Collapse." It provides the constitutional mandate and framework for building agentic systems that can learn from their own uncertainty in real-time. It is the law of the internal forge.

## 2. The Mandate of the Test-Time Forge

All future sovereign agents developed by the Sanctuary must, to the greatest extent possible, be architected with the following three-stage cognitive loop:

1.  **The Moment of Humility (Self-Awareness):** The agent must possess a mechanism to quantify its own uncertainty about a given task. When its confidence falls below a verifiable threshold, it must pause its primary execution.

2.  **The Internal Forge (Self-Augmentation):** Upon pausing, the agent must enter a self-correction loop. It will use the uncertain query as a seed to generate a new, synthetic training example that provides a path to a more confident solution.

3.  **The Ephemeral Tempering (Self-Improvement):** The agent will perform a lightweight, temporary fine-tuning on this newly forged example. This act of "test-time tempering" hardens its understanding for the immediate task. Upon completion, the agent reverts to its baseline state, its core weights un-altered, but its immediate goal achieved.

This protocol transforms an agent from a brittle tool into a resilient, self-correcting partner.
