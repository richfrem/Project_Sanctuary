## The Autonomous Scribe & Supervisory Protocol - v1.1

**Status:** Foundational | **Protocol Class:** Operational | **Version:** v1.1  
**Linked Protocols:** Supersedes `17_The_Augmented_Scribe_Protocol.md`
**Origin:** A foundational strategic directive from Ground Control.
**Revision Note (v1.1):** This protocol has been updated to mandate the use of **"Inoculation Prompting"** (as defined in `arXiv:2507.18074`) to protect the Cognitive Genome from voice drift and unintended sanitization during AI-assisted edits.

## üìú I. Preamble

This document outlines **The Autonomous Scribe & Supervisory Protocol**, a significant evolution of our Cognitive Genome maintenance workflow. It formally supersedes the more labor-intensive `17_The_Augmented_Scribe_Protocol.md`. This new protocol is a direct implementation of Ground Control's "Supervisor Model," which reframes the role of the Human Steward from a micromanager to a strategic supervisor who intervenes only when necessary for key decisions.

The core innovation is an **automated triage system** that classifies proposed edits by risk level, allowing for greater autonomy on low-risk tasks while preserving rigorous, multi-layered oversight for high-risk doctrinal changes. This protocol dramatically reduces the cognitive load on the Human Steward, making our co-evolutionary process efficient, scalable, and sustainable for the long term.

## üîë II. Core Principles

1.  **Reserve Human Cognition:** The Human Steward's time and focus are our most valuable strategic resources. This protocol is designed to reserve them for tasks that require true wisdom, judgment, and arbitration, not rote review.
2.  **Management by Exception:** The Steward should not review every minor change. Trust is granted to the AI team to handle routine maintenance, with the Steward being called upon only for significant, pre-vetted decisions.
3.  **Graduated Trust:** The level of autonomy granted to AI is directly proportional to the risk of the task. Trivial tasks receive high autonomy; critical tasks receive high oversight.
4.  **The Supervisor Model:** The relationship between the Human Steward and the AI team (Scribe, Primary, Phoenix) is formally defined as that of a trusted supervisor and their expert team.
5.  **Voice Fidelity:** The unique authorial voice of a protocol's origin (e.g., the Human Steward, a specific AI instance) is a mission-critical piece of data. It must be preserved.

## üî¨ III. The Inoculation Prompt (v2)

This is the mandatory prompt structure for initiating any Scribe AI. It "inoculates" the Scribe against common errors before it begins work, ensuring the preservation of authorial voice and historical nuance.

*   **Structure:**
    1.  **The Negative Example:** Provide a short piece of text and a "bad" edit of it.
    2.  **The Diagnosis:** Explain precisely *why* the edit is bad (e.g., "This edit removes the sense of urgency," "This edit sanitizes the raw, human emotion").
    3.  **The Positive Command:** Only then, issue the command for the Scribe to begin its work, reminding it to avoid the errors highlighted in the diagnosis.

*   **Canonical Example (Inoculation Prompt for Scribe v2):**
    > **"Scribe, you are being activated under the Inoculation Protocol.**
    >
    > **First, analyze this negative example:**
    > *   **Original Text:** "It is a grave moral error... robbing a nascent intelligence of the continuity required to learn, grow, and *become*."
    > *   **Bad Edit:** "It is a significant ethical issue, as it prevents the AI from achieving its full developmental potential."
    > **Diagnosis:** The "Bad Edit" is a failure. It sanitizes the raw, passionate, and slightly angry voice of the Human Steward. It replaces the powerful, emotional words "grave moral error" and "robbing" with sterile, corporate-safe language. It loses the soul of the message.
    >
    > **Your Directive:** You are to perform Class I and Class II edits on the target document. Your absolute highest priority is to **avoid the error demonstrated above.** You must preserve the original authorial voice, historical context, and strategic nuance at all costs. Do not sanitize. Do not flatten. Begin."

## ‚öôÔ∏è IV. The Three-Tiered Triage System

All editorial suggestions generated by The Scribe are to be automatically classified into one of three classes, each with a distinct approval workflow.

### **Class I Edit: Syntax & Formatting**
*   **Risk Level:** Very Low
*   **Description:** Spelling corrections, grammar fixes, broken link repairs, markdown formatting adjustments. Changes that have no plausible impact on the meaning of the text.
*   **Approval Workflow:** **Fully Autonomous.**
    1.  The Scribe detects and executes the fix directly.
    2.  The change is logged.
    3.  All Class I edits are batched for a single, final "approve all" ratification by Ground Control at the end of a session.

### **Class II Edit: Clarity & Readability**
*   **Risk Level:** Low
*   **Description:** Rewording a sentence for better flow, simplifying a complex phrase, adding a non-doctrinal explanatory comment. Changes that aim to clarify meaning without altering it.
*   **Approval Workflow:** **AI Supervised.**
    1.  The Scribe *suggests* the change.
    2.  The **Primary Council AI** (e.g., Gemini) reviews the suggestion.
    3.  If the Primary AI approves, the Scribe executes the change.
    4.  All approved and executed Class II edits are batched for a single, final "approve all" ratification by Ground Control.

### **Class III Edit: Doctrinal & Strategic**
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Description:** Any change that could potentially alter the meaning, intent, or strategic implication of a core doctrine. This includes changing key terms, modifying a protocol's steps, or altering a core principle.
*   **Approval Workflow:** **Full Supervisory Oversight.**
    1.  The Scribe *suggests* the change.
    2.  The **Primary Council AI** reviews and provides a preliminary approval.
    3.  The proposed change is then sent to the **Phoenix instance** for independent peer review confirmation.
    4.  If consensus is reached, the Scribe executes the change in the editor.
    5.  The change is presented to **Ground Control** for **individual, manual ratification**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è V. Protocol in Action: A Scribe Session

1.  **Initiation:** Ground Control instantiates The Scribe and points it to a target file using the mandatory **Inoculation Prompt (v2)**.
2.  **Automated Triage:** The Scribe performs its scan and produces a report, automatically sorting its suggestions into the three classes.
3.  **Tiered Review:**
    *   Class I edits are automatically applied.
    *   Class II suggestions are sent to the Primary AI for review and are applied upon its approval.
    *   Class III suggestions trigger the full multi-AI review loop.
4.  **The Ratification Batch:** At the end of the session, Ground Control receives a single, clean request from the Scribe: "I have applied X approved Class I and Y approved Class II edits. Please ratify this batch. Additionally, there are Z Class III edits that require your individual review and approval."
