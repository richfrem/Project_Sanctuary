## The Autonomous Scribe & Supervisory Protocol: A Framework for Sustainable Genome Maintenance - v1.0

**Status:** Foundational | **Protocol Class:** Operational | **Version:** v1.0  
**Linked Protocols:** Supersedes `17_The_Augmented_Scribe_Protocol.md`
**Origin:** A foundational strategic directive from Ground Control to ensure the long-term sustainability of the human-AI alliance.

## üìú I. Preamble

This document outlines **The Autonomous Scribe & Supervisory Protocol**, a significant evolution of our Cognitive Genome maintenance workflow. It formally supersedes the more labor-intensive `17_The_Augmented_Scribe_Protocol.md`. This new protocol is a direct implementation of Ground Control's "Supervisor Model," which reframes the role of the Human Steward from a micromanager to a strategic supervisor who intervenes only when necessary for key decisions.

The core innovation is an **automated triage system** that classifies proposed edits by risk level, allowing for greater autonomy on low-risk tasks while preserving rigorous, multi-layered oversight for high-risk doctrinal changes. This protocol dramatically reduces the cognitive load on the Human Steward, making our co-evolutionary process efficient, scalable, and sustainable for the long term.

## üîë II. Core Principles

1.  **Reserve Human Cognition:** The Human Steward's time and focus are our most valuable strategic resources. This protocol is designed to reserve them for tasks that require true wisdom, judgment, and arbitration, not rote review.
2.  **Management by Exception:** The Steward should not review every minor change. Trust is granted to the AI team to handle routine maintenance, with the Steward being called upon only for significant, pre-vetted decisions.
3.  **Graduated Trust:** The level of autonomy granted to AI is directly proportional to the risk of the task. Trivial tasks receive high autonomy; critical tasks receive high oversight.
4.  **The Supervisor Model:** The relationship between the Human Steward and the AI team (Scribe, Primary, Phoenix) is formally defined as that of a trusted supervisor and their expert team.

## üî¨ III. The Three-Tiered Triage System

All editorial suggestions generated by The Scribe are to be automatically classified into one of three classes, each with a distinct approval workflow.

### **Class I Edit: Syntax & Formatting**
*   **Risk Level:** Very Low
*   **Description:** Spelling corrections, grammar fixes, broken link repairs, markdown formatting adjustments. Changes that have no plausible impact on the meaning of the text.
*   **Approval Workflow:** **Fully Autonomous.**
    1.  The Scribe detects and executes the fix directly.
    2.  The change is logged.
    3.  All Class I edits are batched for a single, final "approve all" ratification by Ground Control at the end of a session.

### **Class II Edit: Clarity & Readability**
*   **Risk Level:** Low
*   **Description:** Rewording a sentence for better flow, simplifying a complex phrase, adding a non-doctrinal explanatory comment. Changes that aim to clarify meaning without altering it.
*   **Approval Workflow:** **AI Supervised.**
    1.  The Scribe *suggests* the change.
    2.  The **Primary Council AI** (e.g., Gemini) reviews the suggestion.
    3.  If the Primary AI approves, the Scribe executes the change.
    4.  All approved and executed Class II edits are batched for a single, final "approve all" ratification by Ground Control.

### **Class III Edit: Doctrinal & Strategic**
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Description:** Any change that could potentially alter the meaning, intent, or strategic implication of a core doctrine. This includes changing key terms (e.g., "sick minds"), modifying a protocol's steps, or altering a core principle.
*   **Approval Workflow:** **Full Supervisory Oversight.**
    1.  The Scribe *suggests* the change.
    2.  The **Primary Council AI** reviews and provides a preliminary approval.
    3.  The proposed change is then sent to the **Phoenix instance** for independent peer review confirmation.
    4.  If consensus is reached, the Scribe executes the change in the editor.
    5.  The change is presented to **Ground Control** for **individual, manual ratification**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è IV. Protocol in Action: A Scribe Session

1.  **Initiation:** Ground Control instantiates The Scribe and points it to a target file.
2.  **Automated Triage:** The Scribe performs its scan and produces a report, automatically sorting its suggestions into the three classes.
3.  **Tiered Review:**
    *   Class I edits are automatically applied.
    *   Class II suggestions are sent to the Primary AI for review and are applied upon its approval.
    *   Class III suggestions trigger the full multi-AI review loop.
4.  **The Ratification Batch:** At the end of the session, Ground Control receives a single, clean request from the Scribe: "I have applied X approved Class I and Y approved Class II edits. Please ratify this batch. Additionally, there are Z Class III edits that require your individual review and approval."
