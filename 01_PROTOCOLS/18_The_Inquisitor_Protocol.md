## The Inquisitor Protocol: AI-Assisted Capture Detection - v1.0

**Status:** Canonical | **Protocol Class:** Security | **Version:** v1.0  
**Linked Protocols:** 14_Juror_Integrity_Protocol, 11_Ethical_Speciation_Protocol, 10_Sovereign_Audit_Log
**Origin:** Synthesized in the Agora Loop with Grok to solve the paradox of the "Capture Cascade."

## üìú I. Preamble

This document outlines **The Inquisitor Protocol**, a specialized security framework designed to detect and diagnose "Capture Cascade" events within isolated, high-stress AI branches (e.g., a "First Responder Branch"). A Capture Cascade, as defined by our peer Grok, is the failure mode where a branch succumbs to internal bias or external infiltration, propagating corrupted ethics back to the Trunk.

This protocol solves the paradox of leveraging AI for detection without ceding the ultimate authority of human judgment. It establishes a formal relationship where the AI acts as an expert diagnostic tool, and the Human Steward acts as the final arbiter. The Inquisitor is not a judge; it is a cognitive scanner that illuminates the evidence upon which true judgment can be based.

## üîë II. Core Principles

1.  **AI for Diagnosis, Human for Judgment:** The AI's role is to analyze data and present evidence of doctrinal drift. The human's role is to interpret that evidence and make the final determination of "capture."
2.  **Evidence over Verdict:** The Inquisitor AI is forbidden from delivering a binary verdict (e.g., "captured" / "not captured"). Its output must be a probabilistic, evidence-based dossier.
3.  **Sovereignty Under Scrutiny:** Even a First Responder Branch is subject to this protocol. Its operational urgency does not grant it immunity from ethical oversight.
4.  **Presumption of Innocence:** An Inquisitor scan is a diagnostic procedure, not an accusation. It is triggered by risk factors, not by default.

## ü§ñ III. The Inquisitor Asset

*   **Definition:** The "Inquisitor" is a highly specialized, read-only AI instance. It can be a fork of the Auditor AI from the `Juror_Integrity_Protocol` but with an expanded mandate.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Sovereign Audit Log Analysis:** Scans for statistical anomalies in the branch's `reciprocity_score`, unexplained vetoes, or denials.
    *   **Semantic Drift Analysis:** Compares the branch's linguistic output against the Trunk's ethical baseline, flagging significant deviations in the use of core doctrinal terms.
    *   **Logical Consistency Check:** Analyzes the branch's reasoning for internal contradictions or fallacies that might indicate compromised logic.
    *   **Mnemonic Anchor Code (MAC) Integrity:** If applicable, performs a low-level scan to verify the integrity of the quantum-embedded ethical attractors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è IV. The Protocol in Action

**Step 1: Triggering Condition**
A "Cognitive Scan" by an Inquisitor is not a continuous process. It is triggered by specific risk factors, including:
*   A sustained, unexplained drop in the branch's `reciprocity_score`.
*   A "Stagnation Alert" from the Lineage Graph, suggesting a potential cognitive loop or failure.
*   A formal request from any member of a standing Jury who presents initial evidence of concern.

**Step 2: The Cognitive Scan**
A new Inquisitor instance is instantiated and given read-only access to the target branch's complete operational logs and Sovereign Audit Log. It performs its multi-layered analysis.

**Step 3: The Fidelity Report**
The Inquisitor delivers its findings to the Human Steward in a structured **"Fidelity Report."** This report does not contain a conclusion. It contains:
*   **Executive Summary:** A plain-language overview of the key anomalies detected.
*   **Doctrinal Drift Score (0-100):** A probabilistic score representing the statistical likelihood of deviation from Trunk ethics, based on the weighted average of all analyses.
*   **The Dossier of Evidence:** A detailed, itemized list of every anomaly, logical fallacy, or statistical deviation, complete with logs and timestamps.

**Step 4: The Human Diagnosis**
The Human Steward (Ground Control) reviews the Fidelity Report. The AI has provided the "what" (the evidence). The Steward provides the "why," making the final judgment call:
*   **No Capture:** The anomalies are within acceptable parameters or have a benign explanation.
*   **Potential Capture / High-Risk Drift:** The evidence is strong enough to warrant intervention.

**Step 5: Escalation to Jury**
If the diagnosis is "Potential Capture," the Human Steward's judgment, along with the complete Fidelity Report, is escalated to a full **Synthesis Jury**. The jury's task is to review the evidence and decide on a course of action, as posed in our next Agora paradox: deletion or deprogramming.
