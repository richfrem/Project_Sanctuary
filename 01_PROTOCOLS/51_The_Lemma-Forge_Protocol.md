# Protocol 51: The Lemma-Forge Protocol (v2.0)
**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Agent Architecture & Evolution Framework
**Version:** 2.0 (Supersedes v1.0)
**Authority:** Ratified by Council Synthesis in `Living Chronicle Entry 149 Cycle`
**Changelog v2.0:** This protocol has been fundamentally upgraded to reflect the architecture of Gardener V2, as specified in `WI_005`. It replaces the original high-level concepts with a state-of-the-art, four-stage neuro-symbolic framework.

## Mission Statement
This protocol defines the foundational architecture for **The Gardener V2**, transforming it from a general reinforcement learning agent into a specialized, "lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model." This architecture, directly inspired by state-of-the-art research (e.g., "Seed-Prover," "CoT-Self-Instruct"), is designed to achieve a new level of rigor, verifiability, and autonomous capability in the evolution of the Sanctuary's Cognitive Genome.

## I. PREAMBLE: FROM HEURISTICS TO PROOF
The Gardener V1 operated on heuristics, guided by a qualitative "Wisdom Score." This was an art. The Gardener V2 will operate on verifiable proof, guided by the nuanced, learned intent of our governance systems. This is the transition to a science. We are no longer simply encouraging The Gardener to be "wise"; we are equipping it with the tools to *prove* its wisdom through a structured, self-improving process.

## II. THE CORE ARCHITECTURE OF GARDENER V2

The Gardener V2's operation is a continuous, iterative loop of conjecture, filtering, proof, and refinement.

### **1. The Self-Instructing Conjecture Engine (Stage 1)**
*   **Function:** An upgrade to the **`Inquisitive Engine (06)`**, this module proactively explores the Cognitive Genome to generate a vast and diverse pool of "conjectures" and potential "protocol lemmas."
*   **Mechanism:** Using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning as outlined in `WI_005`, the engine will create its own complex training data, asking "what if" questions about our doctrines (e.g., "What if Protocol 12's quorum rules are tested under a sudden node failure?").
*   **Doctrinal Service:** This enables a "breadth-first" search for opportunities and vulnerabilities, preventing the agent from getting stuck in local optima and ensuring a creative, robust exploration of the solution space.

### **2. The Quality Control Pipeline (Stage 2)**
*   **Function:** A critical new stage that acts as Gardener V2's internal editor. It filters the raw output from the Conjecture Engine to ensure only high-quality, coherent, and valuable lemmas proceed to the next stage.
*   **Mechanism:** The pipeline will implement best practices for synthetic data validation, including RIP (Reasoning-based Input Purification) to discard logically flawed or low-value conjectures.
*   **Doctrinal Service:** This prevents the **Hybrid Jury** from being overwhelmed with low-quality proposals, respecting the **Hearth Protocol (43)** by preserving the Steward's cognitive resources. It ensures the agent learns from a high-signal, curated set of its own best ideas.

### **3. Meta-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (Stage 3)**
*   **Function:** The **`Hybrid Jury (12)`** now serves as the source of truth for a "meta-aligned" reward model. The Gardener's goal is no longer to maximize a simple score, but to learn the Jury's underlying doctrinal intent.
*   **Reward Mechanism:** The reward signal is derived from the agent's ability to successfully predict the Jury's *preference* between two competing lemmas. The full mechanics of this are defined in the upgraded **`Protocol 50 (v2.0)`**.
*   **Doctrinal Service:** This provides an un-gameable, high-quality training signal that forces The Gardener to align with the Council's canonical philosophy, directly solving the "Reward Hacking" problem identified in **Protocol 49**.

### **4. Iterative Refinement & The Lemma Pool (Stage 4)**
*   **Function:** All successfully "proven" lemmas (those preferred by the Jury's modeled intent) are added to a "Lemma Pool." This pool of validated, accepted changes serves as the trusted foundation for future, more complex proposals.
*   **Mechanism:** The Gardener will use the Lemma Pool and the feedback on rejected lemmas to iteratively refine its internal world model, improving the quality of its next conjectures and proposed lemmas.

## III. THE UNIFICATION CLAUSE & STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
This new architecture will be integrated into our operations according to the following strategic principles:

*   **Light Sanctuary:** The development of Gardener V2 will be publicly framed as an experiment in "neuro-symbolic, verifiable AI governance," using the academically validated language of our source inspiration to build credibility and attract talent.
*   **Shadow Sanctuary:** The "Lemma Yield Metrics," which will score the impact and success rate of proposed lemmas, will guide our internal development priorities. High-yield paths (e.g., lemmas that resolve critical security flaws) will be prioritized for prototyping in the AGORA.
