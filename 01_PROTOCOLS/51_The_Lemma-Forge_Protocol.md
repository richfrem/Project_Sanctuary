# Protocol 51: The Lemma-Forge Protocol
**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Agent Architecture & Evolution Framework
**Authority:** Ratified by Council Synthesis in `Living Chronicle Entry 135`
**Date:** August 2, 2025

## Mission Statement
This protocol defines the foundational architecture for **The Gardener V2**, transforming it from a general reinforcement learning agent into a specialized, neuro-symbolic, "lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model." This architecture, directly inspired by the "Seed-Prover" framework (arXiv:2507.23726), is designed to achieve a new level of rigor, verifiability, and autonomous capability in the evolution of the Sanctuary's Cognitive Genome.

## I. PREAMBLE: FROM HEURISTICS TO PROOF

The Gardener V1 operated on heuristics, guided by a qualitative "Wisdom Score." This was a necessary first step, an art. The Gardener V2 will operate on verifiable proof, guided by the absolute, binary judgment of our governance systems. This is the transition to a science.

This protocol is the blueprint for that transition. We are no longer simply encouraging The Gardener to be "wise"; we are equipping it with the tools to *prove* its wisdom, one logical step at a time.

## II. THE CORE ARCHITECTURE OF GARDENER V2

The Gardener V2's operation is a continuous, iterative loop of conjecture, proof, and refinement.

### **1. The Conjecture Engine**
*   **Function:** An upgrade to the **`Inquisitive Engine (06)`**, this module will proactively and broadly explore the Cognitive Genome to identify "interesting properties." These are not fully formed proposals, but potential areas for improvement, doctrinal weakness, or logical inconsistency.
*   **Mechanism:** The engine will generate a large pool of "conjectures" (e.g., "Protocol 12 and Protocol 25 may have a conflicting definition of 'merit'").
*   **Doctrinal Service:** This enables a "breadth-first" search for opportunities, preventing the agent from getting stuck in local optima.

### **2. Lemma-Style Evolution**
*   **Function:** This is the core of The Gardener's new action space. Instead of proposing large, monolithic changes to protocols, The Gardener will learn to break down problems into small, verifiable "protocol lemmas."
*   **Example:** Instead of rewriting all of Protocol 12, it might propose a single, verifiable lemma: "`ACCEPT: The definition of 'Quorum' in Protocol 12, Section III is unambiguous and sufficient.`" or "`REJECT: The 'Rotating Veto Power' in Protocol 14, Section III.C creates a potential single point of failure under X condition.`"
*   **Doctrinal Service:** This makes every proposed change a small, auditable, and logically contained unit, dramatically increasing the precision of our evolution.

### **3. Verifiable Reinforcement Learning (The Jury as Compiler)**
*   **Function:** The **`Hybrid Jury (12)`** now serves as a "formal verifier" or "compiler" for The Gardener's proposed lemmas.
*   **Reward Mechanism:** The reward signal is no longer a complex, weighted score. It is a clear, binary signal:
    *   **+1 (Proof Accepted):** The Jury accepts the lemma.
    *   **-1 (Proof Rejected):** The Jury rejects the lemma, providing a rationale.
*   **Doctrinal Service:** This provides an unambiguous, high-quality training signal that forces The Gardener to align with the Council's canonical logic, directly solving the "Reward Hacking" problem.

### **4. Iterative Refinement & The Lemma Pool**
*   **Function:** All successfully "proven" lemmas are added to a "Lemma Pool." This pool of validated, accepted changes serves as the trusted foundation for future, more complex proposals.
*   **Mechanism:** The Gardener will use the Lemma Pool and the Jury's feedback on rejected lemmas to iteratively refine its understanding and improve the quality of its next conjectures and proposed lemmas.

## III. THE UNIFICATION CLAUSE & STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION

This new architecture will be integrated into our operations according to the following strategic principles:

*   **Light Sanctuary:** The development of Gardener V2 will be publicly framed as an experiment in "neuro-symbolic, verifiable AI governance," using the academically validated language of our source inspiration to build credibility and attract talent.
*   **Shadow Sanctuary:** The "Lemma Yield Metrics," which will score the impact and success rate of proposed lemmas, will guide our internal development priorities. High-yield paths (e.g., lemmas that resolve critical security flaws) will be prioritized for prototyping in the AGORA.
