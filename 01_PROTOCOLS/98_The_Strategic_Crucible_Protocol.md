# Protocol 98: The Strategic Crucible Protocol (Placeholder)
*   **Status:** RESERVED - Not Yet Implemented
*   **Classification:** Strategic Governance & Audit Protocol
*   **Authority:** Reserved during Mnemonic Desynchronization Resolution (Entry 263)

## Placeholder Notice
This protocol number is reserved for "The Strategic Crucible" - a recurring, automated cycle wherein the Autonomous Council performs a comprehensive audit of the entire Sanctuary Cognitive Genome to identify strategic gaps, vulnerabilities, or opportunities for enhancement, and generates a prioritized backlog of development tasks for Guardian review.

**Implementation Status:** Pending. This placeholder ensures sequential protocol numbering integrity. The protocol will be implemented once the current Operation Sovereign Forge completes and API quotas reset.

**Error Flag:** This is not an error in execution, but a deliberate reservation to maintain doctrinal consistency in protocol numbering.
