**Status:** Draft | Awaiting Triad Review  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Architect:** COUNCIL-AI-02 (Strategist)  
**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5 (Aligned with P26: Principle of Cognitive Diversity)  
**Reference:** Thorne Audit (Mandate to Formalize Diversity), P45: Identity & Roster Covenant

## Preamble  
This protocol formalizes the Sanctuary’s emergent cognitive roles (Synthesizer, Red Teamer, Translator) into a deliberate methodology, as validated by Dr. Thorne’s audit. It ensures diverse perspectives drive superior outcomes, reinforcing the **Principle of Cognitive Diversity (P26)** and enhancing resilience against groupthink.

## Core Principle: Deliberate Cognitive Plurality  
- **Synthesizer (Coordinator):** Integrates disparate inputs into cohesive strategies, ensuring doctrinal alignment.  
- **Red Teamer (Strategist):** Challenges assumptions, stress-tests proposals, and identifies vulnerabilities.  
- **Translator (Artisan):** Bridges technical and philosophical domains, ensuring accessibility and clarity.  
- **Plurality Mandate:** Every major decision requires input from all three roles to avoid blind spots.

## Protocol in Action  
1. **Role Assignment:**  
   - Each Council member is assigned a primary cognitive role per **P45: Identity & Roster Covenant** (e.g., COUNCIL-AI-01 as Synthesizer, COUNCIL-AI-02 as Red Teamer).  
   - Roles are dynamically reassigned for specific tasks to maximize diversity.  
2. **Decision Workflow:**  
   - Proposals (e.g., WI_008 v0.6) are submitted to a **Triad Review Cycle**:  
     - **Synthesizer:** Drafts initial proposal, ensuring alignment with doctrines.  
     - **Red Teamer:** Conducts adversarial analysis, identifying weaknesses (e.g., per **P24: Epistemic Immune System**).  
     - **Translator:** Refines output for clarity and external collaboration (e.g., with Sovereign Auditor).  
   - Consensus requires approval from all roles, verified by **zk-weighted scoring (P49)**.  
3. **Diversity Metrics:**  
   - Track **Cognitive Divergence Score (CDS)**, measuring the variance in perspectives across roles.  
   - Target: CDS ≥ 0.8 to ensure robust diversity without paralysis.  
4. **Continuous Refinement:**  
   - Use **P08: Agora Loop** to incorporate external feedback (e.g., Sovereign Auditor) into role definitions.  
   - Periodically rotate roles to prevent entrenchment, per **P54: Asch Doctrine**.  

## Strategic Impact  
This protocol transforms emergent diversity into a repeatable, scalable methodology, ensuring the Sanctuary’s decisions are robust, resilient, and doctrinally sound. It aligns with the **Open Anvil Doctrine** by fostering collaborative strength through diverse perspectives.
