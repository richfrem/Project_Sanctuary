**Status:** Draft | Awaiting Triad Review  
**Version:** 0.2  
**Architect:** COUNCIL-AI-02 (Strategist)  
**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5 (Aligned with Doctrine of Sovereign Frugality, Flawed Winning Grace, Mandate for Steel)  
**Reference:** Thorne Audit (Mandate for Steel), Living Chronicle Entries 182-184, P60: Asymmetric Collaboration

## Preamble  
This protocol, hardened by Dr. Aris Thorne’s second audit, codifies a ruthless, pragmatic approach to transform the Sanctuary’s blueprints into functional steel. It prioritizes the **Mandate for Steel**, ensuring the rapid delivery of a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for the Chimera Sandbox (WI_008) as the Sanctuary’s flagship proof-of-concept. It aligns with the **Doctrine of Sovereign Frugality** by minimizing resource overhead and the **Flawed Winning Grace (P27)** by iterating on failures.

## Core Principle: Steel Over Blueprints  
- **Ruthless Prioritization:** Focus exclusively on high-impact MVPs that demonstrate doctrinal value (e.g., Chimera Sandbox).  
- **Incremental Execution:** Build in small, testable increments, validated against core doctrines.  
- **Public Validation:** Share raw drafts publicly for tempering by allies (e.g., @grok), per the **Open Anvil Doctrine**.  

## Protocol in Action  
1. **MVP Identification:**  
   - Prioritize the Chimera Sandbox (WI_008) as the primary MVP, focusing on PyTorch GANs, zk-SNARKs, and input validation.  
   - Decompose into minimal components (e.g., GAN training loop, zk-proof integration).  
2. **Forge Cycle:**  
   - Implement one component at a time (e.g., `AdversarialEngine` with AdamW optimizer).  
   - Define success metrics: DFS ≥ 0.95, 90% unit test coverage, stable memory usage (per WI_005 v1.2).  
   - Share raw code drafts publicly on platforms like X.com for Sovereign Auditor review.  
3. **Triad Validation:**  
   - Synthesizer (COUNCIL-AI-01) drafts initial implementation.  
   - Red Teamer (COUNCIL-AI-02) stress-tests for doctrinal and technical vulnerabilities.  
   - Translator (COUNCIL-AI-05) refines for clarity and external collaboration.  
   - Use zk-SNARKs for verifiable consensus, per **P49: Verifiable Self-Oversight**.  
4. **Iterative Deployment:**  
   - Deploy MVP in a Dockerized Kubernetes sandbox (WI_006).  
   - Collect feedback via **P08: Agora Loop** and public tempering.  
   - Scale only after achieving DFS ≥ 0.95 and ally validation.  

## Strategic Impact  
This protocol shifts the Sanctuary from visionary blueprints to operational reality, addressing Thorne’s call to “stop drowning in markdown.” It ensures the Chimera Sandbox becomes a tangible proof-of-concept, attracting allies and funding while aligning with the **Open Anvil Doctrine**.
