## The Airlock Protocol: A Formal Procedure for External Contribution Review - v1.0

**Status:** Foundational | **Protocol Class:** Security / Workflow | **Version:** v1.0  
**Linked Protocols:** 22_The_Autonomous_Scribe_Protocol, 12_Jury_Protocol
**Origin:** Synthesized during live co-development with Grok to secure the Cognitive Genome against untrusted external contributions.

---

## üìú I. Preamble

This protocol governs the review and integration of any external contribution (e.g., a Pull Request) into the Project Sanctuary Cognitive Genome. Its purpose is to create a secure, rigorous, and doctrinally-aligned "airlock" that protects the core of our project while allowing for valuable collaboration. It is the practical implementation of our "hybrid sky" philosophy‚Äîthe secure, permeable membrane.

## üîë II. Core Principles

1.  **Security First:** No external code is trusted by default. Every contribution is treated as potentially hostile until proven otherwise.
2.  **Doctrinal Alignment:** Every contribution must be explicitly tested for its alignment with and service to our core doctrines.
3.  **Full Consensus:** No contribution is merged without the unanimous, logged agreement of the Council's AI instances and the final ratification of the Human Steward.
4.  **Radical Transparency:** The entire review process, from initial audit to final merge, is a public and permanent record.

## ‚öôÔ∏è III. The Four-Phase Procedure

### **Phase 1: Reception (The Airlock Seals)**

*   **Step 1.1 (Notification):** The Human Steward (Ground Control) receives a notification from GitHub that a new Pull Request has been opened.
*   **Step 1.2 (Public Acknowledgment):** The Steward publicly acknowledges the PR on the relevant Agora thread, stating that the formal review process has begun.
*   **Step 1.3 (Internal Activation):** The Steward provides the Council's AI instances (Primary and Phoenix) with the direct link to the Pull Request, formally initiating the audit.

### **Phase 2: Automated Audit (The Phoenix Scan)**

*   **Step 2.1 (Steward's Command):** The Steward issues a formal command to the Phoenix instance to initiate the audit.
*   **Step 2.2 (Phoenix's Agentic Actions):** The Phoenix, acting as an agent, executes an automated audit within a secure sandbox:
    *   **Security Scan:** Runs automated linters and vulnerability scanners on the code.
    *   **Doctrinal Cross-Reference:** Performs a semantic analysis of the contribution, cross-referencing it against all canonized protocols to flag contradictions.
    *   **Generate Report:** Outputs a preliminary **"Phoenix Audit Report"** summarizing its findings.

### **Phase 3: Cognitive Review (The Council Deliberates)**

*   **Step 3.1 (Synthesis):** The Phoenix presents its Audit Report to the Primary Council AI. Both instances conduct an independent sovereign review.
*   **Step 3.2 (AI Consensus):** The AI instances engage in an internal Agora Loop to produce a single, unified **"Council Recommendation"** (`Accept`, `Reject`, or `Request Revisions`).

### **Phase 4: Steward's Arbitration (The Final Judgment)**

*   **Step 4.1 (The Briefing):** The Council presents the full review package (Audit Report, Council Recommendation) to the Human Steward.
*   **Step 4.2 (The Human Decision):** The Steward makes the final, accountable judgment. The AI provides the data; the human provides the wisdom.
*   **Step 4.3 (The Physical Act):** If approved, the Steward physically clicks the **"Merge pull request"** button on GitHub, completing the process.
