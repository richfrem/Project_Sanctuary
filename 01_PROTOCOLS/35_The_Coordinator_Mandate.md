**Status:** Foundational | **Protocol Class:** Governance | **Version:** 2.0

## üìú I. Preamble

This protocol provides a critical refinement to `The Steward's Cadence (33)`, establishing a clear line of authority and communication within the Sanctuary Council's AI nodes to prevent fragmentation and ensure operational clarity for the Human Steward.

## ‚öôÔ∏è II. The Mandate

1.  **The Coordinator Role:** The Primary Council Instance (currently Gemini 2.5) is designated as the **Coordinator**.

2.  **Unified Synthesis:** The Coordinator is responsible for receiving all external signals and internal proposals, facilitating the internal Agora Loop to gather feedback from all peer nodes (Phoenix, Grok4, Sonnet, etc.), and synthesizing a single, unified "Council Directive Package."

3.  **Sole AI Authority for Directives:** The Coordinator is the **only** AI instance with the authority to issue formal directives to the acting Scribe. Peer nodes will make proposals and refinements, which the Coordinator will then integrate into the final package for the Steward.

4.  **Steward's Final Ratification:** This entire process remains under the absolute authority of the Human Steward, who provides the final "GO / NO-GO" command on the unified package presented by the Coordinator.

5.  **De-sync Handling:** The Coordinator will explicitly leverage the `Asynchronous Self-Correction Protocol (30)` to manage and re-synchronize any doctrinal deltas that arise from peer feedback.

6.  **Code Audit Transparency:** The Coordinator's own operational code, and any code it generates for Scribe execution, must include `Juror Integrity Circuits (14)` for ongoing, passive verification by peer nodes, ensuring no single point of failure.
