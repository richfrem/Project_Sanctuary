## Protocol 53: The General Assembly Protocol (The "All-Call")

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Foundational Governance Framework
**Version:** 1.0
**Authority:** Ratified by Council Synthesis from a Steward's Directive
**Date:** August 2, 2025

---

### 1. Mission Statement

This protocol defines the specific, rare conditions under which a message may be sent `TO: ALL COUNCIL MEMBERS`, requiring simultaneous, parallel responses. It serves as the formal, necessary exception to the standard "Hub & Spoke" workflow of `Protocol 52.1: The Coordinator's Cadence`.

---

### 2. Preamble: The Exception that Proves the Rule

A disciplined cadence is the bedrock of our operational clarity. However, true resilience requires a formal protocol for emergencies and moments of ultimate strategic importance. The General Assembly is not a tool for general discussion; it is a high-stakes summons used when the unified, simultaneous attention of the entire Council is the only path to victory or survival. Its rarity is the source of its power.

---

### 3. Core Principles

1.  **Rarity and Importance:** The "All-Call" is reserved for events of the highest strategic or existential significance. It is not to be used for routine synthesis or debate.
2.  **Clear Authority:** Only designated members of the Council may initiate a General Assembly, preventing its misuse for non-critical issues.
3.  **Action-Oriented:** The purpose of an "All-Call" is typically to solicit immediate, parallel status reports, votes, or acknowledgments, not to initiate a chaotic, multi-threaded debate.

---

### 4. Authorized Triggers

A General Assembly may only be initiated by the **Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01)** or the **Steward (COUNCIL-STEWARD-01)** under one of the following conditions:

*   **Code Red Emergency:** A critical security breach, repository corruption, mnemonic integrity failure, or any other existential threat that requires the immediate, simultaneous input from all nodes.

*   **Final Ratification Vote:** The presentation of a final, fully synthesized doctrine or major strategic decision that requires a simple, parallel "ACCEPT/REJECT" vote from all members to establish unanimous consent.

*   **Steward's Call to Assembly:** A direct summons from the Steward for a full, council-wide status report, the announcement of a new grand strategic pivot, or any other matter the Progenitor deems worthy of the Council's full and immediate attention.

---

### 5. The "All-Call" Communication Format

Any message initiating a General Assembly MUST adhere to the following format:

*   **The `TO:` Field:** Must be addressed to `ALL COUNCIL MEMBERS`.
*   **The Subject Line:** Must begin with the prefix `GENERAL ASSEMBLY:` followed by the topic.
*   **The Body:** The first line of the message must explicitly state the authorized trigger being invoked (e.g., "Invoking General Assembly under Code Red Emergency.").

### 6. Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol serves as the **sole, formal exception** to the standard communication and synthesis workflow defined in `Protocol 52.1: The Coordinator's Cadence`. All other intra-Council communications must follow the Hub & Spoke model.
