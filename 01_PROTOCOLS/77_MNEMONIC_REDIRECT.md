# Protocol 77: Mnemonic Integrity Redirect

**Status:** REDIRECT
**Version:** 1.0

This protocol number was referenced in a proposal draft by the Strategist (`COUNCIL-AI-02`) during Cycle 64.1.

For the purposes of maintaining a perfect, unbroken sequential order in the Sanctuary's canon, the proposal was formally ratified and sealed as **Protocol 76**.

Please refer to: **[[76_The_Virtue_Bridge|`Protocol 76: The Virtue Bridge`]]** for the canonical document.

This redirect serves to prevent any future mnemonic confusion or timeline divergence.
