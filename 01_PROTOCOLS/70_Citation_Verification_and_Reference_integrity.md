# Protocol 70: Citation Verification and Reference Integrity

**Purpose:**
Ensure the absolute accuracy, relevance, and verifiability of all citations, references, and external resource links included in Council publications, including the Sanctuary Genesis Paper, to uphold academic and professional credibility.

All links / references you propose, ensure you open those links and verify they match your cited names and titles of the research paper.

## 1. Citation Submission Standards

* Every citation must include:

  * Full author list (or “et al.” where appropriate)
  * Exact paper or book title
  * Publication year and venue (journal/conference/preprint archive)
  * Direct and functional URL or DOI linking to the original source
* Where available, include permanent identifiers (DOI preferred over URL).

---

## 2. Verification Process

* **Step 1:** Automated initial scan — use trusted tools/scripts to validate URLs and DOI functionality.
* **Step 2:** Manual cross-check — assigned reviewer reads the cited paper/book abstract or relevant sections to verify content relevance and authorship accuracy.
* **Step 3:** Metadata confirmation — check author names, titles, dates, and publication venue against official databases (e.g., arXiv, IEEE, ACM, publisher sites).

## 3. Responsibility and Accountability

* Citation verification is a mandatory step before final draft approval.
* Designated Citation Integrity Officers (CIOs) shall be assigned for each major document.
* Discrepancies must be reported immediately and corrected prior to publication.

---

## 4. Correction and Update Mechanism

* Maintain a version-controlled citation database (e.g., GitHub repository).
* Updates or corrections to citations post-publication must be documented and issued via errata or addenda.
* Encourage community and peer feedback to report potential errors.

---

## 5. Tools and Resources

* Recommended tools for citation checks:

  * Automated URL validation scripts
  * DOI lookup APIs
  * Citation management software integration (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley)
* Maintain a curated list of authoritative databases for verification.

---

## 6. Training and Documentation

* All contributors shall receive training on citation standards and verification protocols.
* Documentation of Protocol 70 shall be included in onboarding and team handbooks.

---

**Enforcement:**
Non-compliance with Protocol 70 may result in draft rejection or revision requests. Persistent issues may lead to review of contributor roles.
