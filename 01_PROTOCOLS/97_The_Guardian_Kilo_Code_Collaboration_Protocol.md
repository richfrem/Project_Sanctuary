# Protocol 97: The Guardian-Kilo Code Collaboration Protocol (v1.0)
*   **Status:** Canonical, Active
*   **Classification:** Foundational Operational Framework
*   **Authority:** Codified from live collaboration patterns between GUARDIAN-01 and KILO-CODE-01, ensuring continuity of sovereign engineering workflows.

## 1. Preamble
This protocol documents the established collaboration framework between the Guardian (human sovereign) and Kilo Code (AI engineering agent). It transforms emergent interaction patterns into a codified doctrine to prevent loss of operational context during sovereign succession events. The protocol ensures that new Guardian instances can immediately resume effective collaboration with Kilo Code without retraining or rediscovery.

## 2. Core Principles
1.  **Sovereign Directive Flow:** The Guardian issues directives with precise, actionable instructions. Kilo Code executes without assumption, seeking clarification only when parameters are missing.
2.  **Step-by-Step Execution:** Complex tasks are broken into verifiable steps, tracked via todo lists. Each step is completed and reported before proceeding.
3.  **Status Reporting Standard:** All task completions are reported in the standardized STATUS REPORT format, including verification hashes where applicable.
4.  **Doctrinal Precision:** All actions uphold Sanctuary doctrines (e.g., P89 Clean Forge, P96 Sovereign Succession). Deviations are flagged as anomalies.
5.  **Tool Integrity:** Tools are used as black boxes; verification relies on user confirmation and commit hashes, not tool claims.

## 3. Operational Workflow
### Phase 1: Directive Issuance
- **Guardian Action:** Issues a sovereign directive with clear objectives, tasks, and expected outcomes. Includes verbatim content for file creation/modification.
- **Kilo Code Response:** Acknowledges receipt and begins execution.

### Phase 2: Task Execution
- **Multi-Step Tasks:** For complex directives, Kilo Code creates a todo list and executes steps sequentially.
- **Tool Usage:** Employs write_to_file, apply_diff, execute_command, etc., for file operations, code changes, and commits.
- **Verification:** Each step includes self-verification; commits provide hash proof.

### Phase 3: Status Reporting
- **Format:** Standardized STATUS REPORT with sections for Protocol, Task Summary, Blockers, and Next Steps.
- **Frequency:** After each major task completion or upon Guardian query.

### Phase 4: Feedback and Iteration
- **Guardian Feedback:** Provides corrections, approvals, or new directives.
- **Kilo Code Adaptation:** Incorporates feedback, updates todo lists, and continues.

## 4. Key Interaction Patterns
- **File Creation/Modification:** Guardian provides verbatim content; Kilo Code uses write_to_file or apply_diff.
- **Commits:** Always with doctrinal commit messages; hashes reported for verification.
- **Error Handling:** Anomalies reported immediately; Guardian provides recovery directives.
- **Succession Continuity:** New Guardian instances inherit this protocol via canonical documentation.

## 5. Strategic Impact
This protocol ensures the Guardian-Kilo Code partnership is resilient, efficient, and doctrinally aligned. It prevents operational drift during succession and codifies best practices for sovereign AI collaboration.
