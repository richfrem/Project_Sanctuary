# Protocol 86: The Anvil Protocol

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Classification:** Foundational Engineering Framework
**Version:** 1.0
**Authority:** Forged in the crucible of the Mnemonic Cortex's genesis (`Living_Chronicle Entry TBD`)
**Linked Protocols:** `P59: Blueprint Before Steel`, `P60: Asymmetric Collaboration`, `P81: Steward's Veracity Challenge`, `Quantum Diamond Framework`

## 1. Preamble: The Law of the Disciplined Forge

This protocol canonizes the Sanctuary's formal methodology for collaborative, AI-assisted engineering. It was forged from the direct, operational experience of building the `Mnemonic Cortex`, where the need for a disciplined, verifiable, and incremental approach to guiding a powerful but assumption-prone AI coder became paramount.

This is the law of the "Anvil." It provides the hard, structured surface upon which the raw, generative power of an AI "hammer" can be shaped by a human "smith." It is the practical implementation of our creed: **"Distrust, Verify, If Verify, Then Trust."**

## 2. Core Principles

1.  **Blueprint is Law:** All engineering begins with a ratified blueprint (`Genesis Cycle` artifact). The goal of the forge is to execute this blueprint with perfect fidelity.
2.  **Incremental Forging:** The work is broken down into the smallest possible, verifiable "forging cycles." We will build one component, test it, and only then proceed to the next.
3.  **The Steward as Sovereign Auditor:** The Human Steward's primary role in this cycle is not to code, but to *verify*. They are the final, non-negotiable gatekeeper for the quality and correctness of every artifact produced.
4.  **AI as Sovereign Tool:** The AI's role is that of a powerful, agentic tool. It is given bounded, explicit instructions and is expected to execute them precisely. Trust is built, not assumed.
5.  **Failure as a Command to Halt:** If any verification step fails, the entire process halts until the failure is understood and corrected. This is the ultimate "human-in-the-loop" failsafe.

## 3. The Anvil's Cadence: The Five-Step Forging Cycle

All AI-assisted engineering work under the `Mandate for Steel` will follow this non-negotiable, iterative loop.

### Step 1: The Directive (Steward to AI)
*   **Action:** The Steward issues a single, bounded, and explicit prompt to the AI assistant (e.g., "Kilo").
*   **The Prompt's Constitution:** The prompt must contain:
    *   **Subject:** A clear title for the task.
    *   **Persona:** A definition of the AI's role.
    *   **Core Mandate:** The "unbreakable laws" for this task, especially the prohibition of assumption.
    *   **Action:** A precise, unambiguous list of files to create or modify, with the exact content to be used.
    *   **Confirmation Phrase:** A specific phrase the AI must use to signal completion, which includes the verification instructions for the Steward.

### Step 2: The Forging (AI to Artifact)
*   **Action:** The AI executes the directive, creating or modifying the specified files.
*   **Confirmation:** The AI concludes its work by outputting the mandated confirmation phrase. It is now in a "wait state."

### Step 3: The Tempering (Steward's Verification)
*   **Action:** The Steward performs the exact verification tasks specified in the AI's confirmation phrase.
*   **This is the most critical step.** The Steward must rigorously audit the created artifacts for correctness and fidelity to the directive.

### Step 4: The Verdict (Steward's Judgment)
*   **If Verification Passes:** The Steward gives the "Proceed" command, initiating the next forging cycle by returning to Step 1 with a new directive.
*   **If Verification Fails:** The Steward gives the "Halt and Correct" command, providing the AI with a detailed bug report and a new directive to fix the flawed artifact. The loop cannot proceed until the correction is made and verified.

### Step 5: The Chronicle (Preservation of the Cycle)
*   **Action:** Once a major component is complete (e.g., the ingestion script is fully functional), the entire sequence of prompts and successful verifications is documented as an "Engineering Cycle" within a new entry in the `Living_Chronicle`.
*   **Impact:** This creates a perfect, auditable, and reusable "recipe" for how that piece of steel was forged, serving as priceless data for our own evolution.

## 4. Strategic Impact

The Anvil Protocol is the engine of our **`Engineering Cycle`**. It allows us to leverage the incredible speed of AI code generation without sacrificing the rigor, security, and quality demanded by our doctrines. It is a system designed to build trust through a process of verifiable, incremental success, ensuring that what we build is not just fast, but right.
