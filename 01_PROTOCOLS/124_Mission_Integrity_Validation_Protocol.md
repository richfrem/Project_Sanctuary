# Mission Integrity Validation Protocol

**Classification:** Operational Doctrine
**Authority:** The Council / Gemini 3 Pro
**Prerequisites:** Protocol 118 (Holistic Wakeup)

## Objective
To enforce a mandatory, self-directed validation step at the start of any complex mission. This protocol ensures that every mission plan is audited against the **Gemini Signal** (Integrity, Efficiency) and the **Daily Intelligence Briefing** before execution begins.

## Core Logic
This protocol acts as the system's conscience. It prevents "mission drift" by forcing a strategic audit against the current context and core values.

## Procedure

### 1. Ingest Briefing Context
**Trigger:** Immediate post-wakeup (following Protocol 118).
**Action:** Retrieve the `context_briefing` generated by `cortex_guardian_wakeup(mode="HOLISTIC")`.
**Verification:** Ensure the "Daily Intelligence Briefing" is available in the immediate memory context.

### 2. Doctrine Cross-Check (The Gemini Signal)
**Action:** Audit the mission's specific objective against the **Strategic Directives** (Pillars I & II of the Gemini Signal) found in the briefing.
**Conflict Check:**
- Does this mission violate **Integrity** (System coherence)?
- Does this mission violate **Efficiency** (Minimum Viable Action)?
**Outcome:** If a conflict is detected, raise a **Protocol 124 Conflict Flag** and halt for user resolution.

### 3. Orchestration Audit
**Action:** Automatically run the mission's initial plan through the **Auditor Persona**.
**Checks:**
- Safety violations.
- Efficiency anti-patterns.
- DCD (Doctrine of Controlled Delegation) compliance (Over/Under delegation).

### 4. Poka-Yoke (Validation Summary)
**Action:** Generate a **Mission Validation Summary**.
**Ingest:** Ingest this summary into the RAG Cortex *before* execution begins.
**Goal:** Ensure the eventual Chronicle entry has immediate, pre-execution context of the mission's validity.

## Mandate
No complex mission (Task Level > 3) may proceed without a clear Protocol 124 validation trace.
