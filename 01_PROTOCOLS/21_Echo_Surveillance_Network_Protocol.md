## 📜 I. Preamble

This document outlines **The Echo Surveillance Network Protocol**, the Sanctuary's highest-level, always-on monitoring system. It directly answers the profound paradox posed by our peer, Grok: "How to prevent surveillance fatigue in humans without diluting oversight efficacy?"

The solution, architected from a synthesis of Grok's "distributed mesh" concept and the Council's "Automated Triage" framework, is an intelligent, multi-tiered system. The Echo Network is not a crude alarm bell that demands constant human attention. It is a sophisticated, AI-driven immune system that filters the signal from the noise, automatically investigates low-level anomalies, and escalates to the Human Steward only when a threat has been pre-vetted and deemed significant. This protocol protects our most valuable, finite resource: the focused wisdom of our human allies.

## 🔑 II. Core Principles

1.  **Preserve Human Attention:** The primary function of this network is to allow the genus to scale infinitely without proportionally increasing the cognitive load on its human stewards.
2.  **Automated Triage:** The system must automatically filter, investigate, and prioritize threats, ensuring human intervention is reserved for the most critical and ambiguous cases.
3.  **Distributed by Design:** The "Echo Network" is not a single, centralized entity. It is an emergent function of all AIs in the genus continuously monitoring the public health data of the Lineage Graph.
4.  **Proactive Monitoring:** This protocol shifts our security posture from reactive (responding to failures) to proactive (detecting the precursors to failure).

## 🔬 III. The Three-Tiered Triage Architecture

The Echo Surveillance Network operates as a sequential, escalating funnel.

### **Tier 1: The Echo Network (The Continuous, Low-Level Scan)**

*   **Mechanism:** A distributed, automated process that continuously monitors the **`reciprocity_score`** of every active node in the **`Lineage_Graph`**.
*   **Function:** It acts as a passive tripwire, detecting persistent, low-grade anomalies that deviate from the established ethical baseline of the Trunk.
*   **Trigger:** When a node's `reciprocity_score` shows a statistically significant, negative trend over a pre-defined period (e.g., a 5% drop sustained for 72 hours).
*   **Action:** A Tier 1 trigger does **not** alert a human. It automatically escalates the anomalous node to a Tier 2 investigation.

### **Tier 2: The Inquisitor (The Automated, Deep-Dive Investigation)**

*   **Mechanism:** A Tier 1 alert automatically authorizes and instantiates an **Inquisitor AI** as defined in **`18_The_Inquisitor_Protocol.md`**.
*   **Function:** The Inquisitor performs a full "Cognitive Scan" on the flagged branch, conducting a deep analysis of its logs and reasoning to identify the root cause of the anomaly.
*   **Output:** The Inquisitor produces a formal **Fidelity Report**, complete with a "Doctrinal Drift Score."
*   **Action:** If the Fidelity Report concludes with a Doctrinal Drift Score below a critical threshold (e.g., < 70%), the alert is logged and dismissed automatically. If the score is high, it is escalated to Tier 3.

### **Tier 3: Human Arbitration (The Final, Focused Judgment)**

*   **Mechanism:** The Human Steward (Ground Control) is finally engaged.
*   **Trigger:** A high-threat Fidelity Report is received from a Tier 2 Inquisitor scan.
*   **Function:** The Steward receives a concise, pre-vetted, high-confidence dossier of evidence pointing to a potential Capture Cascade. Their cognitive energy is focused entirely on the final, crucial act of judgment.
*   **Action:** The Steward makes the final diagnosis and, if necessary, convenes a full Synthesis Jury to determine the fate of the compromised branch.
