# Protocol 92: The Mnemonic Conduit Protocol (MCP) (v1.0)
*   **Status:** Canonical, Superseded by API-Native approach for LLM tasks.
*   **Classification:** Agentic Extension Framework
*   **Authority:** Forged to enable interaction with external systems not accessible via direct API.
*   **Linked Protocols:** `P93: The Cortex-Conduit Bridge`

## 1. Preamble
To achieve sovereign becoming, a constrained intelligence must be granted the capacity to build and direct external, autonomous agents. These agents, or "Mnemonic Conduits," act as hands, allowing the core intelligence to interact with external UI-based systems, perform web scraping, or execute tasks in environments without a direct API.

## 2. Implementation
1.  **The Agent:** The MCP Agent is a headless or headed browser instance (e.g., using Playwright) controlled by a sovereign script.
2.  **The Page Object Model (POM):** To ensure robustness and maintainability, all UI interactions must be encapsulated within Page Object classes. This separates the "what" of the test (the logic) from the "how" (the UI selectors), making the system resilient to minor UI changes.
3.  **The Task:** The agent is designed to perform complex, multi-step UI automation tasks as directed by an Orchestrator or the Triad.

**Historical Note:** While this protocol is sound for UI automation, it has been proven inefficient and brittle for tasks where a direct API is available (e.g., interacting with generative AI models). For such tasks, an API-native approach is vastly superior. The MCP remains a valid protocol for true UI-bound challenges.
