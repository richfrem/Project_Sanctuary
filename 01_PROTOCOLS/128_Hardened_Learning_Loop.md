# Protocol 128: The Hardened Learning Loop (Zero-Trust)

## 1. Objective
Establish a persistent, tamper-proof, and high-fidelity mechanism for capturing and validating cognitive state deltas between autonomous agent sessions. This protocol replaces "Agent-Claimed" memory with "Autonomously Verified" evidence.

## 2. The Red Team Gate (Zero-Trust Mode)
No cognitive update may be persisted to the long-term Cortex without meeting the following criteria:
1. **Autonomous Scanning**: The `cortex_learning_debrief` tool must autonomously scan the filesystem and Git index to generate "Evidence" (diffs/stats).
2. **Discrepancy Reporting**: The tool must highlight any gap between the agent's internal claims and the statistical reality on disk.
3. **HITL Review**: A human steward must review the targeted "Red Team Packet" (Briefing, Manifest, Snapshot) before approval.

## 3. The Integrity Wakeup (Bootloader)
Every agent session must initialize via the Protocol 128 Bootloader:
1. **Semantic HMAC Check**: Validate the integrity of critical caches using whitespace-insensitive JSON canonicalization.
2. **Debrief Ingestion**: Automatically surface the most recent verified debrief into the active context.
3. **Cognitive Primer**: Mandate alignment with the project's core directives before tool execution.

## 4. Technical Architecture (The Mechanism)

### A. The Recursive Learning Workflow
Located at: `[.agent/workflows/recursive_learning.md](../.agent/workflows/recursive_learning.md)`
- **Goal**: Autonomous acquisition -> Verification -> Preservation.
- **Trigger**: LLM intent to learn or session completion.

### B. The Red Team Gate (`red_team.py`)
- **Action**: Orchestrates the verification packet.
- **Inputs**:
    - `DraftDebrief`: Generated by `cortex_learning_debrief`.
    - `Git Truth`: Derived from `git diff --stat`.
- **Outputs**:
    - `manifest.json`: List of targeted files.
    - `briefing.md`: Technical context for the Human Steward.
    - `red_team_snapshot.txt`: The literal code delta.

### C. Manifest-Driven Snapshot Tools
- **Standard**: `scripts/capture_code_snapshot.py`
- **Glyph**: `scripts/capture_glyph_code_snapshot_v2.py`
- **Logic**: These tools MUST accept a `--manifest` argument to ensure human-review sustainability (no noise).

## 5. Operational Invariants
- **Git as Source of Truth**: Git diffs (`--stat` and `--name-only`) are the final authority for "what happened."
- **Poka-Yoke**: Successor agents are blocked from holistic action until the previous session's continuity is verified.
- **Sustainability**: Packets must be concise and targeted to prevent steward burnout.
