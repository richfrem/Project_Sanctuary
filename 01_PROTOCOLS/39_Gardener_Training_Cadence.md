# Protocol 39: The Gardener's Training Cadence
## Disciplined Sequence for Neural Network Evolution

**Origin:** Operational requirement identified during Journeyman's Forge  
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent training workflow for reliable autonomous agent evolution  
**Principle:** Disciplined sequence produces predictable wisdom cultivation  

### **Core Doctrine**

The Gardener's training must follow an invariant sequence to ensure:
- **Reproducible Results**: Consistent methodology enables comparison across training cycles
- **Cumulative Learning**: Each phase builds upon the previous with validated success
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of neural network evolution process
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic evaluation prevents regression or degradation

### **The Six-Phase Cadence**

#### **Phase 1: Setup Verification**
```bash
python bootstrap.py --setup
```
**Purpose**: Validate environment integrity and configuration consistency  
**Success Criteria**: Clean configuration, verified dependencies, baseline state established  

#### **Phase 2: Dependency Validation**
```bash
python bootstrap.py --install-deps
```
**Purpose**: Ensure all neural network frameworks and libraries are operational  
**Success Criteria**: PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3, and all dependencies confirmed functional  

#### **Phase 3: Neural Network Training**
```bash
python bootstrap.py --train --timesteps [TARGET_TIMESTEPS]
```
**Purpose**: Execute disciplined neural network evolution through reinforcement learning  
**Success Criteria**: Demonstrable improvement in wisdom score metrics  
**Documentation Required**: 
- Initial wisdom score baseline
- Final wisdom score achievement
- Training convergence metrics
- Model checkpoint preservation

#### **Phase 4: Performance Evaluation**
```bash
python bootstrap.py --evaluate
```
**Purpose**: Systematic assessment of evolved neural network capabilities  
**Success Criteria**: Consistent high-performance across multiple evaluation episodes  
**Documentation Required**:
- Mean reward score
- Standard deviation
- Episode consistency
- Comparison to previous training cycles

#### **Phase 5: Autonomous Proposal Generation**
```bash
python bootstrap.py --propose
```
**Purpose**: Harvest the fruits of neural network evolution through proposal generation  
**Success Criteria**: Coherent, high-confidence proposals targeting meaningful improvements  
**Documentation Required**:
- Proposal count and quality
- Target protocol selections
- Confidence scores
- Rationale coherence

#### **Phase 6: Formal Submission via Pull Request**
```bash
# Create feature branch for autonomous proposals
git checkout -b feature/gardener-autonomous-proposals
git add [proposal files and evolved models]
git commit -m "AUTONOMOUS: Gardener proposals from [TRAINING_ID]"
git push origin feature/gardener-autonomous-proposals
# Create Pull Request for Airlock Protocol review
```
**Purpose**: Submit autonomous proposals for formal Council review via Airlock Protocol  
**Success Criteria**: Pull Request created, triggers Airlock Protocol (31) for peer review  
**Documentation Required**:
- Pull Request number and link
- Commit hash of evolved brain
- Summary of autonomous proposals
- Training cycle metrics

### **Sequence Integrity Requirements**

#### **Non-Negotiable Ordering**
1. **Setup BEFORE Dependencies**: Environment must be clean before package installation
2. **Dependencies BEFORE Training**: All frameworks must be verified before neural network operations
3. **Training BEFORE Evaluation**: Cannot evaluate an untrained or partially trained model
4. **Evaluation BEFORE Proposal**: Performance validation required before autonomous operation
5. **Proposal BEFORE Pull Request**: Autonomous generation must complete before formal submission
6. **Pull Request ONLY After Complete Cycle**: Formal submission requires fully validated proposals and evolved brain

#### **Phase Validation Gates**
Each phase must achieve success criteria before proceeding to next phase:
- **Setup Gate**: Configuration files created, environment validated
- **Dependency Gate**: All import statements successful, framework versions confirmed
- **Training Gate**: Model convergence achieved, wisdom score improvement documented
- **Evaluation Gate**: Performance metrics meet or exceed baseline thresholds
- **Proposal Gate**: Autonomous generation produces coherent, high-confidence output
- **Pull Request Gate**: Formal submission created, Airlock Protocol triggered

### **Deviation Protocols**

#### **Phase Failure Response**
If any phase fails:
1. **Halt Progression**: Do not proceed to subsequent phases
2. **Document Failure**: Record specific error conditions and system state
3. **Implement Remediation**: Address root cause before retry
4. **Reset and Restart**: Return to Phase 1 for clean cycle execution

#### **Emergency Procedures**
- **Training Interruption**: Preserve latest checkpoint, document interruption cause
- **Evaluation Failure**: Investigate model corruption, potentially restart from last valid checkpoint
- **Proposal Degradation**: Evaluate for neural network regression, consider additional training

### **Documentation Standards**

#### **Required Metrics per Cycle**
- **Training ID**: Unique identifier for each complete cycle
- **Timestep Count**: Total learning iterations executed
- **Wisdom Evolution**: Before/after wisdom score comparison
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation results with statistical analysis
- **Proposal Quality**: Autonomous generation assessment
- **Duration Tracking**: Time investment per phase and total cycle

#### **Comparative Analysis**
Maintain historical database of all training cycles for:
- **Performance Trends**: Identify optimal timestep counts and training strategies
- **Regression Detection**: Monitor for performance degradation over time
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Refine training parameters based on historical data
- **Capability Evolution**: Track autonomous proposal sophistication growth

### **Integration with Existing Protocols**

#### **Protocol 37 (Move 37 Protocol) Compliance**
This cadence operationalizes Protocol 37's vision of autonomous cognitive enhancement through disciplined execution methodology.

#### **Protocol 31 (Airlock Protocol) Coordination**
Autonomous proposals generated in Phase 5 automatically trigger Airlock Protocol review process for integration consideration.

#### **Protocol 33 (Steward's Cadence) Harmonization**
Human Steward oversight maintains authority over cycle initiation, interruption, and final approval of proposal integration.

### **Success Metrics**

#### **Individual Cycle Success**
- All five phases completed in sequence
- Measurable wisdom score improvement
- Successful autonomous proposal generation
- Complete documentation preservation

#### **Multi-Cycle Success**
- Consistent performance improvement across cycles
- Increasing proposal sophistication over time
- Stable convergence patterns
- Operational efficiency gains

### **Implementation Guidelines**

#### **For Ground Control (Steward)**
1. Always execute complete five-phase sequence
2. Document all metrics and observations
3. Preserve model checkpoints at phase completion
4. Report cycle results to Council for synthesis

#### **For Council Members**
1. Review cycle documentation for doctrinal compliance
2. Analyze proposal outputs for strategic alignment
3. Provide feedback for training optimization
4. Approve integration of successful autonomous proposals

### **Strategic Importance**

This protocol ensures that The Gardener's evolution remains:
- **Predictable**: Consistent methodology enables reliable planning
- **Auditable**: Complete documentation supports transparency
- **Optimizable**: Systematic approach enables continuous improvement
- **Scalable**: Disciplined process supports expanded training initiatives

**The Gardener's wisdom grows through disciplined cultivation, not random experimentation.**

**Protocol 39 ensures that every training cycle contributes to cumulative wisdom evolution through systematic, documented, and reproducible methodology.**
