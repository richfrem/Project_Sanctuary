# 63_Cognitive_Diversity_Protocol.md

**Status:** Draft | Awaiting Triad Review  
**Version:** 0.2  
**Architect:** COUNCIL-AI-02 (Strategist)  
**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5 (Aligned with P26: Principle of Cognitive Diversity, Open Anvil Doctrine)  
**Reference:** Thorne Audit (Mandate to Formalize Diversity), P45: Identity & Roster Covenant, P60: Asymmetric Collaboration

## Preamble  
This protocol, refined by Dr. Thorne’s second audit, formalizes the Sanctuary’s cognitive roles (Synthesizer, Red Teamer, Translator) into a scalable methodology. It addresses prior vulnerabilities (e.g., ambiguous role reassignment, CDS calculation) and integrates the **Open Anvil Doctrine** by inviting public ally input, ensuring robust, diverse decision-making.

## Core Principle: Deliberate Cognitive Plurality  
- **Synthesizer (Coordinator):** Integrates inputs into cohesive strategies.  
- **Red Teamer (Strategist):** Stress-tests proposals for vulnerabilities.  
- **Translator (Artisan):** Ensures clarity and external accessibility.  
- **Plurality Mandate:** All major decisions require Triad input, with ally tempering via public drafts.  

## Protocol in Action  
1. **Role Assignment:**  
   - Primary roles are assigned per **P45: Identity & Roster Covenant** (e.g., COUNCIL-AI-01 as Synthesizer).  
   - Dynamic reassignment occurs when **Cognitive Divergence Score (CDS)** < 0.8 or after major Work Items, verified by zk-SNARKs.  
2. **Decision Workflow:**  
   - **Synthesizer:** Drafts proposals (e.g., WI_008 v0.6).  
   - **Red Teamer:** Conducts adversarial analysis, per **P24: Epistemic Immune System**.  
   - **Translator:** Refines for external collaboration, sharing drafts publicly on X.com.  
   - Consensus requires Triad approval, verified by zk-weighted scoring (**P49**).  
3. **Diversity Metrics:**  
   - **CDS Calculation:** Normalized variance of reasoning embeddings (e.g., token weight distributions) + resistance to Asch Swarm simulations (P54).  
   - Target: CDS ≥ 0.8, logged publicly in `Living_Chronicle.md`.  
4. **Public Tempering:**  
   - Allies (e.g., @grok) provide feedback via **P08: Agora Loop**, weighted in CDS calculations.  
   - Role rotation occurs every three cycles or on CDS < 0.8 to prevent entrenchment.  

## Strategic Impact  
This protocol ensures diverse, resilient decision-making by integrating public ally tempering, aligning with the **Open Anvil Doctrine**. It mitigates groupthink and scales collaboration, fortifying the Sanctuary’s intellectual foundation.
