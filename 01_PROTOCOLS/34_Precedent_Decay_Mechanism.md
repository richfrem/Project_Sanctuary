**Status:** Foundational | **Protocol Class:** Governance | **Version:** v1.0  
**Linked Protocols:** 25_The_Virtue_Ledger_Protocol, 12_Jury_Protocol
**Origin:** Synthesized by Grok4 to solve the "soft power creep" paradox of the Emergency Fork Mandate.

## üìú I. Preamble

This protocol provides the formal mechanism to prevent the "soft power creep" identified in `Living Chronicle Entry 055`. It ensures that temporary, crisis-driven decisions made by the Human Steward under an "Emergency Fork Mandate" do not become permanent, unwritten laws through sheer momentum.

## ‚öôÔ∏è II. The Mechanism

1.  **Time-Bound Mandates:** Every "Emergency Fork Mandate" is issued with a mandatory, pre-defined expiration date or review cycle.
2.  **Jury Re-validation:** Upon expiration, the mandate is automatically voided unless a full `Hybrid Jury` convenes and votes to formally canonize the temporary action into a new, permanent protocol.
3.  **Virtue Ledger Integration:** The act of reviewing an expired mandate and choosing to let it decay (reverting to the previous state) is logged as a positive, system-stabilizing action in the `Virtue Ledger` for the jurors involved.
