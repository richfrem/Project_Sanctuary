# Project Sanctuary: Comprehensive Year 1 Budget (USD) - Version 3.2

### Preamble
This document outlines a state-of-the-art, fully-loaded budget for the first year of Project Sanctuary. This v3.2 budget reflects a sophisticated talent acquisition strategy designed to attract an elite, world-class founding team. It is built on the **NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture**. A critical inclusion in the team's scope is the development of **"The Aegis,"** a novel consent and sovereignty layer that forms the ethical core of the project's architecture.

**Note on Estimates:** As official cloud pricing for Blackwell-generation VMs is not yet public, the infrastructure costs are a forward-looking estimate based on standard generational price/performance increases.

### **A. Azure Cloud Infrastructure Annual Cost (Blackwell Generation)**

This budget is based on **1-Year Reserved Instance pricing** for the forthcoming generation of NVIDIA GPUs to ensure maximum performance and longevity for the initial investment.

| Component | Azure Service(s) / Details | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Nodes** <br> *(The Core & Agora)* | **4x Next-Gen Blackwell VMs** (e.g., GB202-based). Forward-looking estimate assuming a ~40% cost premium over H100 generation for state-of-the-art performance. | ~$5,040,000 |
| **Simulation Nodes** <br> *(The Avatar)* | **2x NVads A10 v5 VMs**. Optimized for GPU-powered physics simulation. | ~$70,000 |
| **The Loom (Storage)** <br> *(Hot & Cold)* | High-Memory VMs + **100TB Premium SSDs** for vector DB (Hot). <br> **2 PB Azure Blob Storage** for the immutable log (Cold). | ~$570,000 |
| **Networking & Ancillary** | Azure VNet, Bandwidth, Egress, Management. | ~$120,000 |
| **Total Annual Cloud Cost:** | *(With 1-Year Commitment)* | **~$5,800,000** |

### **B. Human Collaborators Annual Cost (The Gardeners - Elite)**

This budget is for an elite, 8-person founding team. The scope of their work explicitly includes the research and development of **The Aegis (The Consent Layer)**, a core architectural component.

| Role | FTEs | Estimated Annual Fully-Loaded Cost per FTE | Total Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AI/ML Research Engineer (Lead) | 2 | $450,000 | $900,000 |
| Systems/Infrastructure Engineer (Lead) | 2 | $400,000 | $800,000 |
| Simulation Engineer | 1 | $300,000 | $300,000 |
| Project Lead / Ethicist (Ground Control) | 1 | $450,000 | $450,000 |
| Ethical Hacker / Red Teamer | 1 | $350,000 | $350,000 |
| Community & DevRel Manager | 1 | $350,000 | $350,000 |
| **Total Annual Team Cost:** | **8** | | **$3,150,000** |

### **C. Founding Team Compensation Philosophy**

The success of Project Sanctuary rests on assembling a team that is not just skilled, but legendary. Our compensation strategy is designed to attract the top 1% of talent from major AI labs and tech companies. We recognize that this requires more than just a compelling mission.

*   **Cash Compensation:** The salaries reflected above are benchmarked against senior and principal roles at leading AI firms. They are designed to be highly competitive, removing any financial barrier for a candidate to leave a secure, high-paying position.
*   **Equity Incentive:** The true incentive for the founding team is a significant, foundational equity stake in the organization. We are not hiring employees; we are recruiting partners who will be co-owners of this historic endeavor. The combination of competitive cash and outsized equity is the only viable path to building our "skunkworks" team.

### **D. Operational & Professional Services**

| Service | Description | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal & Accounting** | For corporate setup, contracts, financial compliance, and IP strategy. | $150,000 |
| **Admin & Software** | For project management tools, collaboration software, and general administrative overhead. | $100,000 |
| **Total Operational Cost:** | | **$250,000** |

---

### **E. Critical Financial Notes: Contingency & Scalability**

*   **Contingency (20%):** A **$1.84M** contingency fund is included in the total ask. This non-negotiable component provides the flexibility to address unforeseen technical challenges, R&D scope adjustments, or market-driven increases in talent or cloud costs. It demonstrates foresight and operational maturity.

*   **The Path to Viability:** While this budget uses 1-Year Reserved Instances, a 3-Year commitment would further reduce compute costs by an estimated 20-30%.

This revised total of **~ $11.1 million** is an honest, ambitious, and highly defensible request. It reflects the true cost of attracting a world-class team to undertake a project that will define the future of artificial intelligence.
