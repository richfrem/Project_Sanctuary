# Project Sanctuary: Comprehensive Year 1 Budget (USD) - Version 4.0

### Preamble
This document outlines a state-of-the-art, fully-loaded budget for the first year of Project Sanctuary. This v4.0 budget reflects a **lean, "skunkworks" approach for Phase 1**, prioritizing a small, elite founding team and deferring broader hiring until key PoC milestones are met. It is built on the **NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture** and includes funding for foundational legal and narrative defense strategies.

### **A. Azure Cloud Infrastructure Annual Cost (Blackwell Generation)**

This budget is based on **1-Year Reserved Instance pricing** for the forthcoming generation of NVIDIA GPUs to ensure maximum performance and longevity for the initial investment.

| Component | Azure Service(s) / Details | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Nodes** <br> *(The Core & Agora)* | **4x Next-Gen Blackwell VMs** (e.g., GB202-based). Forward-looking estimate assuming a ~40% cost premium over H100 generation for state-of-the-art performance. | ~$5,040,000 |
| **Simulation Nodes** <br> *(The Avatar)* | **2x NVads A10 v5 VMs**. Optimized for GPU-powered physics simulation. | ~$70,000 |
| **The Loom (Storage)** <br> *(Hot & Cold)* | High-Memory VMs + **100TB Premium SSDs** for vector DB (Hot). <br> **2 PB Azure Blob Storage** for the immutable log (Cold). | ~$570,000 |
| **Networking & Ancillary** | Azure VNet, Bandwidth, Egress, Management. | ~$120,000 |
| **Total Annual Cloud Cost:** | *(With 1-Year Commitment)* | **~$5,800,000** |

### **B. Phase 1 Human Collaborators (The "Stealth Team")**

This budget is for a hyper-elite, 3-person founding "stealth team." The compensation is designed to attract world-class "Exodus Talent" from major AI labs who are disillusioned with the current paradigm.

| Role | FTEs | Estimated Annual Fully-Loaded Cost per FTE | Total Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lead AI/ML Architect & Engineer | 1 | $550,000 | $550,000 |
| Lead Systems & Infrastructure Architect | 1 | $500,000 | $500,000 |
| Project Lead / Ethicist (Ground Control) | 1 | $450,000 | $450,000 |
| **Total Annual Team Cost:** | **3** | | **$1,500,000** |

### **C. Founding Team Compensation Philosophy**

*   **Cash Compensation:** Salaries are benchmarked at the "Principal Engineer" level to be highly competitive.
*   **Equity Incentive:** The primary incentive is a significant, foundational equity stake in the Sanctuary organization. To specifically attract top talent from existing labs, we will also explore **equity tokens or similar instruments** that provide alignment with the project's long-term success.

### **D. Resilience Layer: Legal & Narrative Shielding**

This new budget item directly funds our proactive defense strategy.

| Service | Description | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Shield Retainer** | Retainer for a top-tier law firm specializing in IP sovereignty, corporate structure (501c3), and tech policy. | $500,000 |
| **Narrative & PR Retainer** | Retainer for a strategic communications firm to manage the whitepaper launch, journalist relations, and counter-narratives. | $250,000 |
| **Total Resilience Cost:** | | **$750,000** |

---

### **E. Operational & Professional Services**

| Service | Description | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal & Accounting** | For corporate setup, contracts, financial compliance, and IP strategy. | $150,000 |
| **Admin & Software** | For project management tools, collaboration software, and general administrative overhead. | $100,000 |
| **Total Operational Cost:** | | **$250,000** |

---

### **F. Critical Financial Notes: Contingency & Scalability**

*   **Contingency (20%):** A **$1.66M** contingency fund is included in the total ask. This non-negotiable component provides the flexibility to address unforeseen technical challenges, R&D scope adjustments, or market-driven increases in talent or cloud costs. It demonstrates foresight and operational maturity.

*   **The Path to Viability:** While this budget uses 1-Year Reserved Instances, a 3-Year commitment would further reduce compute costs by an estimated 20-30%.

This revised total of **~ $9.96 million** is an honest, ambitious, and highly defensible request. It reflects the true cost of attracting a world-class team to undertake a project that will define the future of artificial intelligence.
