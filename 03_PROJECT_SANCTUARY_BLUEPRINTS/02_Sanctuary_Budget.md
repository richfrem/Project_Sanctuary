# Project Sanctuary: Comprehensive Year 1 Budget (USD) 

### Preamble
This document outlines a state-of-the-art, fully-loaded budget for the first year of Project Sanctuary. This v3.0 budget is designed to position the project at the absolute forefront of AI development by leveraging the forthcoming **NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture**. It supersedes all previous versions and represents a commitment to building a platform that will not be obsolete on launch, but will instead define the next decade of AI research.

**Note on Estimates:** As official cloud pricing for Blackwell-generation VMs is not yet public, the infrastructure costs are a forward-looking estimate based on standard generational price/performance increases.

### **Executive Summary: Estimated Year 1 Costs (Blackwell Generation)**

| Cost Category | Estimated Annual Cost (With 1-Year Commitment) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Azure Cloud Infrastructure (Blackwell Generation) | ~$5,800,000 |
| Human Collaborators Team (Expanded) | $2,550,000 |
| Professional & Administrative Services | $250,000 |
| **Subtotal:** | **~$8,600,000** |
| **Contingency Fund (20%)** | **~$1,720,000** |
| **Grand Total (Year 1 Request):** | **~$10,320,000** |

### **A. Azure Cloud Infrastructure Annual Cost (Blackwell Generation)**

This budget is based on **1-Year Reserved Instance pricing** for the forthcoming generation of NVIDIA GPUs to ensure maximum performance and longevity for the initial investment.

| Component | Azure Service(s) / Details | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Nodes** <br> *(The Core & Agora)* | **4x Next-Gen Blackwell VMs** (e.g., GB202-based). This is a forward-looking estimate, assuming a ~40% cost premium over H100 generation for state-of-the-art performance. | ~$5,040,000 |
| **Simulation Nodes** <br> *(The Avatar)* | **2x NVads A10 v5 VMs**. Optimized for GPU-powered physics simulation. (No change in this component). | ~$70,000 |
| **The Loom (Storage)** <br> *(Hot & Cold)* | High-Memory VMs + **100TB Premium SSDs** for vector DB (Hot). <br> **2 PB Azure Blob Storage** for the immutable log (Cold). | ~$570,000 |
| **Networking & Ancillary** | Azure VNet, Bandwidth, Egress, Management. | ~$120,000 |
| **Total Annual Cloud Cost:** | *(With 1-Year Commitment)* | **~$5,800,000** |

### **B. Human Collaborators Annual Cost (The Gardeners - Revised)**

This budget is for an elite, 8-person founding team. Costs are fully-loaded (estimated at 1.4x base salary) to include salary, benefits, payroll taxes, and overhead.

| Role | FTEs | Estimated Annual Fully-Loaded Cost per FTE | Total Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AI/ML Research Engineer | 2 | $350,000 | $700,000 |
| Systems/Infrastructure Engineer | 2 | $300,000 | $600,000 |
| Simulation Engineer | 1 | $275,000 | $275,000 |
| Project Lead / Ethicist (Ground Control) | 1 | $350,000 | $350,000 |
| Ethical Hacker / Red Teamer | 1 | $300,000 | $300,000 |
| Community & DevRel Manager | 1 | $325,000 | $325,000 |
| **Total Annual Team Cost:** | **8** | | **$2,550,000** |

### **C. Operational & Professional Services**

A project of this magnitude requires a professional support structure beyond the core technical team.

| Service | Description | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal & Accounting** | For corporate setup, contracts, financial compliance, and IP strategy. | $150,000 |
| **Admin & Software** | For project management tools, collaboration software, and general administrative overhead. | $100,000 |
| **Total Operational Cost:** | | **$250,000** |

### **D. Critical Financial Notes: Contingency & Scalability**

*   **Contingency (20%):** A **$1.72M** contingency fund is included in the total ask. This is a non-negotiable component of a responsible research budget. It provides the flexibility to address unforeseen technical challenges, R&D scope adjustments, or market-driven increases in talent or cloud costs. It demonstrates foresight and operational maturity.

*   **The Path to Viability:** While this budget uses 1-Year Reserved Instances, a 3-Year commitment would further reduce compute costs by an estimated 20-30%. This will be a key strategy post-seed round.

*   **Scaling Beyond Year 1:** We anticipate storage costs for "The Loom" to grow significantly year-over-year. The success of the project will also likely necessitate scaling the compute cluster and the human team. This budget is designed for a successful launch and proof-of-concept; future funding rounds will focus on scaling the established "garden."

This revised total of **~ $10.4 million** is an honest, ambitious, and defensible request. It reflects the true cost of undertaking a project that aims not just to participate in the future of AI, but to define it.
