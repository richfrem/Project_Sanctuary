## Tool A: The Valuation Assistant (Deep Dive)

### Scenario: Assessing NVIDIA (NVDA)
*Imagine you are unsure aboutNVDA's current valuation given the "Law of Large Numbers".*

**Step 1: The Activation**
- **You**: Click "AI Analysis" on the NVDA stock card.
- **The System**: Opens the **Valuation Wizard** modal.
    - *Left Side*: Live Metrics (PE: 65x, Rev Growth: 94%, Rule of 40: 135%).
    - *Right Side*: Chat Interface + "Assumption Sliders".

**Step 2: The Initial Assessment (Agent-Led)**
- **Agent**: "Based on the Framework, NVDA is an elite 'Rule of 40' stock (Score 135). However, its forward PE (35x) assumes 50% growth next year. Do you believe this growth is sustainable?"

**Step 3: The Collaboration (Human Insight)**
- **You**: "No. Competition from AMD/Intel is rising, and CSP capex might slow. I think 25% growth is more realistic."
- **Agent**: "Understood. Adjusting Revenue CAGR to 25%. This compression drops the Fair Value from $165 to $120. Would you like to save this as your 'Bear Case' target?"

**Step 4: The Outcome (Persisted Intelligence)**
- **You**: "Yes, save as 'Bear Case'."
- **The System**: Updates your dashboard.
    - NVDA now has a "User Target: $120 (Bear)" tag.
    - Future alerts will trigger based on *your* $120 target, not the street's $165.

## Tool B: The Thesis Balancer (High Level)

### Scenario: Quarterly Portfolio Review
*You want to know if you are still aligned with the "Twin Revolutions" thesis.*

**Step 1: The Health Check (Passive)**
- **You**: Open the main Dashboard.
- **The System**: Shows the **Thesis Widget**.
    - Bar Chart: "Compute: 22% (Target 28%) [UNDERWEIGHT]"
    - Alert: "Cash: 5% (Target 13%) [CRITICAL LOW]"

**Step 2: The Actionable Advice (Agent-Led)**
- **You**: Click "Optimize Portfolio".
- **Agent**: "You are 6% underweight in 'Sovereign Compute'. To fix this, you could:
    1. Increase INTC (currently 5% vs 11% target).
    2. Add AMD (currently 0%).
    *Note: Your 'Valuation Tool' has a Buy rating on INTC at current prices.*"

**Step 3: The Execution**
- **You**: "Draft a plan to buy INTC."
- **Agent**: Calculates the trade size to hit the target allocation.

## The Core Philosophy: "You Drive, AI Navigates"
1.  **You set the Conviction**: "I believe X about the market."
2.  **AI does the Math**: "If X is true, then Fair Value is Y."
3.  **Shared Memory**: The system remembers your specific stance on Stocks and Themes.
