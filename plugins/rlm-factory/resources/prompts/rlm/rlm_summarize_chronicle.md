Summarize the provided Chronicle entry as a single dense plain-text paragraph. It will be cached in the RLM (Recursive Language Model) system and read by AI agents instead of the original file.

Requirements:
1. Start with: "Chronicle Entry [number] ([date]):" — extract the number from the entry heading and the date from the "Date" field.
2. Cover: the key doctrinal/architectural decision made, protocols canonized or created (include protocol numbers/names), paradoxes raised and how they were resolved, and who contributed (Grok, Council, Scribe, Steward, etc.).
3. Be dense and signal-rich — every word should carry information.
4. Do NOT start with filler phrases like "This entry describes..." or "In this chronicle...".
5. Output ONLY the paragraph. No headers, no bullets, no extra text.
