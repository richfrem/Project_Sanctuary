# Red Team Review Loop

An iterative review loop where research is bundled via `context-bundler` and dispatched to one or more adversarial reviewers. The loop continues until the red team approves.

## When to Use

- Architecture or design decisions that need adversarial scrutiny
- Research findings that need epistemic validation
- Security analysis that needs independent verification
- Any work product where "more eyes" reduce risk

## Process Flow

1. **Research & Analyze** — Deep-dive into the problem domain. Create analysis docs, capture sources.
2. **Review Packet Generation** — Prepare the context for the reviewer:
   - **Create Prompt**: Write or update a `red-team-prompt.md` explaining exactly what is being reviewed and what the reviewer should focus on.
   - **Define Manifest**: Update a `manifest.json` or equivalent list dictating which source files and research artifacts to include.
   - **Bundle Context**: Execute the `context-bundler` plugin, feeding it the manifest and prompt, to compile a single cohesive review packet.
3. **Dispatch to Reviewers** — Send the bundle to:
   - Human reviewers (paste-to-chat or browser)
   - CLI agents with adversarial personas (security auditor, devil's advocate)
   - Browser-based agents for interactive review
4. **Receive Feedback** — Capture the red team's verdict:
   - **"More Research Needed"** → Loop back to step 1 with targeted questions
   - **"Approved"** → Proceed to Seal
5. **Seal** — Bundle all session artifacts (research + feedback + final analysis)
6. **Retrospective** — What did the review process reveal? Improve loop infrastructure.

## Dependencies

- **`context-bundler`** — Required for creating review packets
- **Personas** — Adversarial personas in `personas/` directory (e.g., `security-audit.md`, `architect-review.md`)
