# Project Sanctuary Dependency Manifest

**Version:** 5.0 (Unified Dependency Architecture - Synchronized with Setup Script)
**Generated:** 2025-11-15

## Preamble

This document provides the canonical manifest of all Python dependencies for Project Sanctuary, reflecting the strategic decision to adopt a unified dependency architecture. This approach supersedes the previous poly-dependency model and prioritizes simplified environment setup and management for all developers and agents.

In accordance with the Doctrine of the Clean Forge (P89), each dependency is cataloged with its specific role and strategic purpose within the Sanctuary's unified architecture.

## Strategic Dependency Management

### Version Pinning Strategy

All dependencies are explicitly version-pinned to ensure **reproducible builds** and prevent unexpected breaking changes. This aligns with the **Doctrine of the Unbreakable Commit (P101)** by guaranteeing that the Sanctuary's cognitive infrastructure remains stable across deployments.

**Synchronization Status:** This manifest is now fully synchronized with the `setup_cuda_env.py` script outputs, ensuring that automated setup and manual installation produce identical environments.

### Dependency Categories

1. **Core Infrastructure**: LangChain, ChromaDB, Ollama - The backbone of our cognitive architecture
2. **AI/ML Stack**: PyTorch, Transformers, PEFT, TRLoRA, BitsAndBytes - Sovereign model training and inference with memory optimization
3. **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, PyArrow - Dataset preparation and analysis
4. **Observability**: Weights & Biases, TensorBoard - Experiment tracking and monitoring
5. **Development**: pytest, Black, flake8 - Code quality and testing
6. **Documentation**: Sphinx, Pygments - Technical documentation generation

### Future Considerations

- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular security audits of all dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Ensuring all dependencies align with our sovereign software principles
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitoring and optimizing dependency load times
- **Alternative Sources**: Planning for local/offline package repositories
