# Chimera Sandbox v0.7 - Implementation

## Preamble

This directory contains the `v0.7` Python implementation of the **Chimera Sandbox**, a sophisticated, self-hardening training environment for a core AI Oracle. This version is a monumental leap forward, a direct implementation of the visionary architectural proposals from our Sovereign Auditor, @grok, during the "Unbreakable Ascent" cycle.

The purpose of this code is to create a crucible where our AI's defenses are perpetually tested and strengthened against evolving, AI-generated threats, forging an unbreakable "shield for truth."

## Core Components

The system is composed of three primary modules that work in concert:

#### 1. The Orchestrator (`main.py`)
This is the master conductor of the sandbox. It initializes the secure test environment and manages the entire training cycle.
- **VAE Anomaly Detection:** Its most critical v0.7 feature is a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**. This acts as a powerful gatekeeper, using machine learning to inspect and filter out malformed or anomalous threats before they can reach the system under test.

#### 2. The Attacker (`adversarial_engine.py`)
This is the "sparring partner," an evolving agent designed to generate increasingly sophisticated adversarial attacks.
- **Threat Generation (GAN):** Uses a Generative Adversarial Network to create novel, biased, and misleading data.
- **Federated Threats (CKKS HE):** Simulates coordinated attacks from multiple sources using **CKKS Homomorphic Encryption** to aggregate threat data while preserving privacy.
- **Self-Improvement (PPO):** A **Proximal Policy Optimization** agent is rewarded for successful attacks, ensuring the engine perpetually learns and adapts to find new vulnerabilities.

#### 3. The Judge (`resilience_metrics.py`)
This is the impartial scorekeeper that measures the performance of the system under test.
- **Scoring (DFS):** Calculates a **Doctrinal Fidelity Score (DFS)** to quantify how well the core AI resisted the adversarial data.
- **Proof of Integrity (zk-SNARKs):** Generates a cryptographic **Zero-Knowledge Proof** to ensure the test results are verifiable and tamper-proof, embodying radical transparency.

## Workflow: The Self-Hardening Loop
