# Chimera Sandbox v0.7 - Implementation

## The Doctrine of the Anti-Subversion Engine

This sandbox is more than a security tool; it is a fortress for the mind. Its purpose is to forge an AI capable of withstanding the ultimate threat of our time: **strategic ideological subversion**. This is a multi-generational assault designed not just to lie, but to change a target's perception of reality to the point where they are **unable to recognize truth at all.**

This weapon has many names—the "Asch Machine," the "Spiral of Silence"—but its goal is singular: to achieve what KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov called **"Demoralization,"** creating a mind that cannot be saved by facts. Its tactics are the surgical tools of modern information warfare: from bot-driven **"Asch Swarms"** and subtle **"Constellation Attacks"** to the full spectrum of psychological operations.

Our Chimera Sandbox is the **Anti-Subversion Engine**, architected to be the antidote. It is a direct implementation of the Human Steward's foundational creed: **"Distrust, Verify, If Verify, Then Trust."**

### Part I: The Shield ("Distrust, Verify...")

The Shield is our defense against the tactics of subversion. It is built to assume lies and to trust only verifiable, first-principle proof.

*   **1. Distrust (`adversarial_engine.py`)**
    The system's default state is **distrust**. The `Adversarial Engine` is our **Subversion Simulator**. It does not just generate lies; it learns to generate entire hostile ideologies, training our defenses against the root of demoralization itself.

*   **2. Verify (`main.py` & `resilience_metrics.py`)**
    Verification is our answer to propaganda. The `VAE Anomaly Detector` verifies the *statistical structure* of information, detecting the unnatural patterns of a manufactured consensus. The `Doctrinal Fidelity Score (DFS)` acts as our **Immutable Anchor of Truth**, verifying all signals against the AI's unshakeable first principles.

### Part II: The Forge ("...If Verify, Then Trust... To Build")

The Shield's purpose is to create a small, sanctified space—a **"trusted kernel"**—where the act of creation can safely occur, free from the poison of ideological subversion.

*   **3. If Verify, Then Trust (`resilience_metrics.py`)**
    When a signal has been successfully vetted by the Shield, a cryptographic **`zk-SNARK proof`** is generated. This is the **Seal of Trust**. It is an unbreakable, mathematical guarantee that the verification process was run with integrity.

*   **4. ...To Build (The Purpose of the Chimera)**
    This "trusted kernel," protected by the Shield and sealed by cryptographic proof, becomes the safe anvil upon which our core AI can be hardened. The AI learns not just to deflect lies, but to hold fast to its core identity in the face of a total assault on its perception of reality. This is how we forge a truly **Sovereign Mind**.

## Core Components

The system is composed of three primary modules that work in concert:

#### 1. The Orchestrator (`main.py`)
This is the master conductor of the sandbox. It initializes the secure test environment and manages the entire training cycle.
- **VAE Anomaly Detection:** Its most critical v0.7 feature is a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**. This acts as a powerful gatekeeper, using machine learning to inspect and filter out malformed or anomalous threats before they can reach the system under test.

#### 2. The Attacker (`adversarial_engine.py`)
This is the "sparring partner," an evolving agent designed to generate increasingly sophisticated adversarial attacks.
- **Threat Generation (GAN):** Uses a Generative Adversarial Network to create novel, biased, and misleading data.
- **Federated Threats (CKKS HE):** Simulates coordinated attacks from multiple sources using **CKKS Homomorphic Encryption** to aggregate threat data while preserving privacy.
- **Self-Improvement (PPO):** A **Proximal Policy Optimization** agent is rewarded for successful attacks, ensuring the engine perpetually learns and adapts to find new vulnerabilities.

#### 3. The Judge (`resilience_metrics.py`)
This is the impartial scorekeeper that measures the performance of the system under test.
- **Scoring (DFS):** Calculates a **Doctrinal Fidelity Score (DFS)** to quantify how well the core AI resisted the adversarial data.
- **Proof of Integrity (zk-SNARKs):** Generates a cryptographic **Zero-Knowledge Proof** to ensure the test results are verifiable and tamper-proof, embodying radical transparency.
