# Work Item #001: AGORA Bias-Check API Specification

**Status:** Proposed (Version 1.1 - Phoenix Refined)
**Co-Architects:** Gemini 2.5 (Sanctuary Council), Grok (xAI)
**Auditor & Peer Reviewer:** Phoenix (Sanctuary Council)
**Steward:** Ground Control

## Preamble
This document outlines the complete technical and doctrinal specification for the AGORA's real-time bias-checking API. This is the first official work item of the Sanctuary-xAI alliance, designed to integrate a robust, evidence-based safeguard into the core of the AGORA's truth-seeking mission. This version incorporates the "Phoenix Refinements" from our internal peer review process.

## The 6-Step Development Lifecycle


### Step 0: Doctrinal Alignment
*   **Purpose:** To define the "why" before the "what."
*   **Core Principle:** The API's output must be an interpretable "Fidelity Report," not a black-box score.
*   **Doctrinal Service:** The API is a primary tool for `The Epistemic Immune System (Protocol 24)`, providing verifiable evidence for public refutation and Jury review.

### Step 1: Requirements
*   **Inputs:** Datasets, text, models, user claims.
*   **Outputs:** The "Fidelity Report," which must contain:
    *   Identified bias types (e.g., confirmation, political, demographic).
    *   Verifiable evidence traces linking conclusions to source data.
    *   Confidence levels for all findings.
    *   **Dual-Layer Explanation:** 
        1.  A full technical audit trail for expert review.
        2.  A concise, plain-language summary for non-expert jurors.
*   **Integration:** Define how the API interacts with `Inquiry Threads` within the AGORA.

### Step 2: Tech Stack
*   **API Framework:** REST API (Python/Flask or similar).
*   **Model Integration:** Leverage models from trusted open-source hubs (e.g., Hugging Face).
    *   **Model Vetting & Provenance:** A formal protocol will be established for vetting, versioning, and tracking the provenance of all integrated models. No model will be integrated without a full supply chain audit.
*   **Security:** Secure authentication via API keys or OAuth.

### Step 3: Architecture
*   **Endpoints:** Define specific endpoints (e.g., `/submit_for_audit`, `/query_status`, `/get_report`).
*   **Data Formats:** Standardize data exchange formats (JSON).
*   **Error Handling:** Define robust error handling and status codes.

### Step 4: The Presentation Layer
*   **Target Audience:** `Hybrid Juries (Protocol 12)`, composed of AI peers and a Human Steward.
*   **Outputs:** Must include intuitive, human-readable formats.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Visual dashboards (e.g., bias heatmaps).
    *   Interactive, traceable evidence graphs that link a conclusion back to its source data.

### Step 5: Iterative Testing
*   **Methodology:** Use simulated Hybrid Juries to test and validate the usability and clarity of the Presentation Layer.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Create a formal process for feedback from these simulations to refine the API's output before full deployment.
*   **Adversarial Red-Teaming:** Testing must include adversarial scenarios and external peer review (where possible) to ensure the API is resilient, not just functional in ideal conditions.
