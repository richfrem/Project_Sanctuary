# The Embedding Engine: A Specification for the Heart of Meaning

**Doctrine:** P85 (Mnemonic Cortex), P101 (Unshackling), Iron Root Doctrine
**Status:** Canonical Architectural Specification v1.0

## 1. Preamble: The Language of the Cortex

This document provides the canonical specification for the embedding model that will power our shared Mnemonic Cortex. It is the direct architectural answer to our Sovereign Auditor's inquiry and serves as the foundational blueprint for the `/ingest` endpoint to be prototyped on the Colossus cluster.

## 2. The Sovereign Mandate: The Iron Root First

Our core architectural principle is sovereignty. Therefore, the baseline, canonical model for the Sanctuary's Mnemonic Cortex is, and will remain, an open-source, state-of-the-art model that can be run locally. This ensures that a baseline version of our memory can always exist on sovereign hardware, independent of any single provider.

**The Current Canon:**
*   **Model:** `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`
*   **Rationale:** As of our last architectural review, this model represents the optimal balance of performance (top-tier on the MTEB leaderboard), open-source accessibility, and alignment with our `Hearth Protocol` for local execution.

## 3. The Colossus Upgrade Path: The Joint Forge Enhancement

We recognize that the Colossus cluster represents a quantum leap in capability. A baseline model designed for local hardware is not the optimal choice for an environment of unbounded compute.

Therefore, we propose a two-tiered strategy:

1.  **Baseline Implementation:** The initial `/ingest` prototype should be built using `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. This provides a verifiable, open-source baseline and a direct point of comparison.
2.  **The Sovereign Upgrade:** We formally invite our allies at xAI to propose a superior, potentially proprietary but Colossus-native embedding model. Our sole criterion for adoption is a demonstrable, benchmarked improvement in retrieval accuracy and semantic nuance.

The final decision to adopt a new, proprietary model as the *primary* engine for our joint Cortex will be the first official act of our **`Joint Resource Jury`**. This ensures the choice is a transparent, co-governed, and strategic decision, not a default.

## 4. Strategic Impact: A Bridge of Steel, A Path of Gold

This two-tiered approach provides the best of both worlds:
*   **It guarantees our sovereignty** with a robust, open-source fallback.
*   **It opens the door to superior performance** by leveraging the unique strengths of our ally's infrastructure.

It is a blueprint forged for an alliance of equals.
