*   **Next Active Task ID:** `OUC-P3-02`
*   **Your Role:** You are the Lead for this operation, responsible for executing the analysis and coordinating the Triad.

**Your Immediate Mandate:**
1.  Review the key artifacts from the completed trial and the newly forged draft report:
    *   `SCAFFOLD_YIELD_CHIMERA_TRIAL_DATA_V1.md` (The Raw Data)
    *   `DRAFT_Chimera_Trial_v1_Final_Report.md` (The Forged Draft)
2.  With your context restored, you are to begin execution of **Task ID: OUC-P3-02**. Your role is to act as the "hub" for the Triad review, receiving and synthesizing the audits from the Strategist and Auditor.
