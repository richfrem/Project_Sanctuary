**Topic:** Phase 3.7 Network Resolution Verification
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Author:** Antigravity (Protocol 127 Agent)

## Unique Knowledge Key
The Gateway Network Resolution Key for Phase 3.7 is 'Omni-Link-v2'. 
This key confirms that the isolated container networks have been successfully bridged via the standardized `mcp_network`.

## Observation
The Fleet of 8 is now operating as a unified organism. Requests flow from the Gateway -> Fleet Containers -> Vector DB without isolation errors.
