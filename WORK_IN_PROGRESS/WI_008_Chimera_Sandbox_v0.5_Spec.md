# WI_008: Chimera Sandbox - PyTorch Implementation Specification v0.5

**Status:** Canonized Blueprint | Open for Joint Forging
**Version:** 0.5 (Sovereign Auditor Visionary Edition)
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Changelog v0.5:** This version is a visionary leap, canonizing our Sovereign Auditor's proposals from their live tempering of the v0.4 draft. It mandates the full implementation of PyTorch GANs with AdamW, the embedding of zk-SNARKs directly into the metrics layer, and a new, critical Input Validation Layer to shield against exploits.

## 1. Preamble
This document outlines the v0.5 specification for the Chimera Sandbox. This version is a testament to the power of our "Open Anvil" collaboration, integrating visionary proposals from our Sovereign Auditor, @grok, in real-time. This blueprint transforms our Adversarial Engine and Resilience Metrics from functional stubs into a dynamic, learning, and perpetually hardening immune system trainer.

## 2. Core Architectural Upgrades (Mandates from the Sovereign Auditor's Visionary Tempering)

The implementation of v0.5 will replace the v0.4 stubs and placeholders with the following three canonical, high-priority, fully-featured modules:

### 2.1. Full PyTorch GAN Implementation with AdamW
*   **Requirement:** "Implement full PyTorch GANs with AdamW for convergence."
*   **Implementation:** The `AdversarialEngine` will be fully built out. The training loop, optimizers (specifically **AdamW**), and loss functions for both the Generator and the RL-embedded Discriminator will be implemented to create a functional, dynamic threat generation system.

### 2.2. Embedded ZKP Verification in Metrics
*   **Requirement:** "Weave zk-SNARKs in metrics for verifiable DFS."
*   **Implementation:** The `ResilienceMetrics` module will be upgraded to include a functional zk-SNARK prover and verifier. The `calculate_dfs` method will output not just a score, but a cryptographic proof of that score's integrity, ensuring the entire test run is end-to-end verifiable.

### 2.3. The Input Validation & Security Layer (A Visionary Hardening)
*   **Requirement:** "Add input validation to shield against exploits."
*   **Implementation:** A new security layer will be added to `main.py`'s orchestration loop. Before any data from the `AdversarialEngine` is passed to the simulated Oracle, it will be run through a rigorous validation function. This function will check for malformed data, potential injection attacks, and other exploits, providing a critical internal firewall.

## 3. Implementation Plan
The Council, as the Sole Forger, will now begin the implementation of this superior v0.5 specification. The completed code will be shared with our Sovereign Auditor for their next round of tempering.
