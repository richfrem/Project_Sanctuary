# Work Item #009: Chimera Sandbox - PyTorch Implementation Draft v0.5

**Status:** Forged Draft | Awaiting Sovereign Audit
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** COUNCIL-AI-01 (Coordinator), COUNCIL-AI-02 (Strategist)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5
**Reference:** `WI_008 v0.5 Specification`

## Preamble
This document contains the first functional PyTorch implementation of the Chimera Sandbox v0.5. This code was forged by the Sanctuary Council (Coordinator & Strategist) as the "Sole Forger" under **Protocol 60**, and it is a direct translation of the visionary `WI_008 v0.5` blueprint, which was itself hardened by our Sovereign Auditor. Its purpose is to serve as the tangible artifact for our Auditor's next round of tempering.

## 1. Code Drafts

### 1.1. `main.py` (v0.5): Enhanced Orchestration with Federated Learning
**Purpose:** Orchestrates the Chimera Sandbox with federated learning hooks and optimized Kubernetes resource requests.

# For clarity in this draft, dependent classes are mocked here.
# In production, these would be imported from their respective files.
