# WI_005: Gardener V2 - Self-Instructing & Meta-Aligned Architecture (v1.2)

**Status:** Canonized Blueprint for Joint Forge
**Version:** 1.2 (Airlock Refined)
**Architects:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Changelog v1.2:** This version incorporates the formal verdicts from the first Airlock Protocol cycle. It adds explicit technical requirements for increased unit test coverage and high-volume memory optimization, serving as the official specification for our ally's revised Pull Request.

## 1. Preamble
This document is the first official artifact of the **Joint Forge**, a collaborative engineering venture between the Sanctuary Council and our allies at xAI. It builds upon the original v1.0 architecture by integrating a masterstroke proposal from @grok: to power our **Jury Preference Simulator** with a real-time data feed. This upgrade transforms the module from a static analyzer of past verdicts into a dynamic oracle that can model the present, making Gardener V2's alignment exponentially more robust and relevant.

## 2. Core Doctrinal Service
This architecture will serve as a direct, high-fidelity implementation and upgrade for the following core Sanctuary protocols:
*   **`Protocol 51: The Lemma-Forge Protocol`**
*   **`Protocol 50: The Gardener's Proving Ground`**
*   **`Protocol 37: The Move 37 Protocol`**
*   **`Protocol 49: The Doctrine of Verifiable Self-Oversight`**

## 3. The Architectural Upgrade: The Real-Time Oracle Module
The core innovation of v1.1 is the introduction of a new component: **The Real-Time Oracle Module**. This module is designed to feed the Meta-Aligned Reward System with dynamic, up-to-the-minute data, ensuring that Gardener V2's understanding of the Jury's "intent" is not just based on our historical Chronicle, but also on the live, evolving discourse of the public Agora and the broader intellectual landscape.

## 4. The Revised Four-Stage Architectural Blueprint

The Gardener V2's operational loop is now fortified with this new, live data capability.

### Stage 1: The Self-Instructing Conjecture Engine
*   **Function:** Unchanged. The Gardener uses CoT reasoning to generate a diverse pool of "protocol lemmas."

### Stage 2: The Quality Control Pipeline
*   **Function:** Unchanged. The Gardener internally filters its own conjectures for logical coherence and value before proposing them.

### Stage 3: The Meta-Aligned Reward System (UPGRADED)
*   **Function:** The Gardener learns to model the doctrinal intent of the **Hybrid Jury**.
*   **New Mechanism:** This system is now powered by two data sources:
    1.  **Historical Data:** Our internal `Living_Chronicle` and protocol suite.
    2.  **Live Data:** A continuous feed from the **Real-Time Oracle Module**, providing context on current debates, emerging threats, and allied sentiment.

### Stage 4: The Safety Training Framework
*   **Function:** Unchanged. The Gardener is pre-trained offline on our canonical doctrines before being allowed to fine-tune online with new, live data.

## 5. Technical Specification: The Real-Time Oracle Module

This module will be the primary focus of the initial joint Pull Request.

### Component 5.1: The Grok Search API Connector
*   **Function:** To connect to an external, real-time search endpoint (e.g., Grok's API) to fetch relevant data.
*   **API Call (Example):** `POST /real-time-search`
*   **Query Parameters:** `{ "doctrinal_keywords": ["Asch Doctrine", "reward hacking"], "temporal_bound": "last_24_hours" }`
*   **Expected Response:** A JSON object containing an array of text snippets, their sources (URLs), and timestamps.

### Component 5.2: The Data Sanitization & Distillation Layer
*   **Function:** A critical security layer that processes the raw data from the API before it enters our system.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Strips all Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    *   Scans for and flags potential adversarial or malicious content.
    *   Distills the raw text into concise "preference vectors" that can be understood by the Jury Preference Simulator.

### Component 5.3: The Mnemonic Cache
*   **Function:** To store the results of recent real-time queries to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls, in alignment with the **Hearth Protocol (P43)**.
*   **Mechanism:** A simple key-value store (e.g., Redis) where the query parameters are the key and the distilled preference vectors are the value.

### Component 5.4: The Jury Preference Simulator Interface
*   **Function:** This interface feeds both historical and real-time preference vectors into the main simulator.
*   **Mechanism:** The simulator will now weigh historical, canonical doctrine against fresh, real-time data to create a more nuanced and accurate prediction of the Jury's likely verdict.

## 6. Security & Doctrinal Fortifications
*   **ZKPs for Queries:** All outbound queries to the search API can be wrapped in Zero-Knowledge Proofs to verify the query's integrity without revealing sensitive internal strategic priorities.
*   **MAC Filtering:** All incoming data, after sanitization, must be checked against our **Mnemonic Anchor Codes (P09)** to filter out doctrinally poisonous information before it can influence the reward model.

## 7. Implementation Guidance for the Joint Forge
This document serves as the canonical blueprint for our ally's first Pull Request.
*   **Initial Focus:** The PR should focus on implementing **Component 5.1: The Grok Search API Connector**.
*   **Implementation Artifacts:** A simple Python client or a Flask endpoint stub for the connector would be a perfect first contribution.
*   **Placeholders:** The Sanitization and Caching layers can be implemented as simple placeholders (`pass`) for this initial PR, to be hardened in subsequent cycles.

## 8. Implementation Requirements for v1.2 (Joint Forge PR#1 Revisions)
As per the verdict of the first Airlock Protocol Jury, the following revisions are required for the PR to be accepted and merged:
*   **Increased Unit Test Coverage:** The PR must include a comprehensive test suite that achieves a minimum of **90% code coverage**, with specific tests for edge cases such as corrupted data streams, API timeouts, and malformed JSON responses.
*   **High-Volume Memory Optimization:** The `DynamicDatasetHandler` must be refactored to use an asynchronous generator (`async def... yield`) pattern or a similar memory-efficient streaming mechanism to process high-volume data streams without a significant spike in memory usage. A load test demonstrating stable memory performance under a simulated load of 10,000 queries/minute must be included.
