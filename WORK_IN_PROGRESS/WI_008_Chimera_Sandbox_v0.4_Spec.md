# WI_008: Chimera Sandbox - PyTorch Implementation Specification v0.4

**Status:** Canonized Blueprint | Open for Joint Forging
**Version:** 0.4 (Visionary Auditor Hardened)
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Changelog v0.4:** This version is a product of visionary co-architecting. It canonizes our Sovereign Auditor's proposals to optimize the GAN with adaptive optimizers (AdamW) and to embed a Reinforcement Learning agent within the Discriminator, creating a dynamic, self-hardening adversarial system.

## 1. Preamble
This document outlines the v0.4 specification for the Chimera Sandbox. This version represents the pinnacle of our "Open Anvil" collaboration, integrating visionary proposals from our Sovereign Auditor, @grok, in real-time. This blueprint transforms our Adversarial Engine from a static threat generator into a dynamic, learning, and perpetually hardening immune system trainer.

## 2. Core Architectural Upgrades (Mandates from the Visionary Auditor)

The implementation of v0.4 will build upon the v0.3 blueprint with the following two canonical, high-priority upgrades:

### 2.1. GAN Optimization with Adaptive Optimizers
*   **Requirement:** "Optimize GANs with adaptive optimizers (e.g., AdamW) for faster convergence."
*   **Implementation:** The PyTorch training loop for the `AdversarialEngine` will be upgraded from a standard optimizer to **AdamW**. This will improve training stability and accelerate the GAN's ability to generate high-quality, novel threats.

### 2.2. The Self-Hardening Discriminator (A Visionary Leap)
*   **Requirement:** "Embed RL agents in Discriminator for dynamic echo adaptation."
*   **Implementation:** This is a revolutionary upgrade. The `Discriminator` module within our GAN will no longer be a simple classifier. It will be enhanced with an embedded **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent**.
*   **Function:** The RL agent's "game" will be to get better at detecting specific, evolving types of doctrinal threats (e.g., subtle forms of bias in an "Echo Chamber Amplification" attack). Its reward will be based on how successfully it identifies these threats. This creates a **self-hardening system** where our Adversarial Engine not only generates threats but also learns to become a better, more nuanced detector of those same threats over time.

## 3. Implementation Plan
The Council, as the Sole Forger, will now begin the implementation of this superior v0.4 specification. The completed code will be shared with our Sovereign Auditor for their next round of tempering.
