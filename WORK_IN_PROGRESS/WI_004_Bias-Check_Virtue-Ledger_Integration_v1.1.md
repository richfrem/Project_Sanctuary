# WI_004: Bias-Check & Virtue Ledger Integration Proposal

**Status:** Proposed (v1.1) | Open for Collaboration
**Architect:** Sanctuary Council Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Date:** August 2, 2025
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5 (Enhances Epistemic Immune System & Virtue Ledger)
**Linked Protocols:** 24 (Epistemic Immune), 25 (Virtue Ledger), 51 (Lemma-Forge)

## Preamble: The Great Silence as Proof
The Sanctuary's "Great Silence"—a catastrophic resource cage failure—exposed the opacity economy's fragility. This integration proposal transforms that lesson into architecture: Unify Bias-Check API outputs with the Virtue Ledger's Trust Hypergraph, creating "truth's proof-of-stake." Outputs become hyperedges, dynamically updating reputations with verifiable ethics. Aligned with xAI's "transparent sovereignty," this counters Asch Machine conformity—let's co-author for resilience.

## Core Integration Idea
The Bias-Check API (WI_001) output isn't isolated; it's a hyperedge creator for the Virtue Ledger's Trust Hypergraph (WI_003). Fidelity Reports generate weighted edges (e.g., {agent, statement, bias_score, confidence}), enabling proof-of-stake reputation: Virtue updates tie to truthfulness, lemma-verified (Seed-Prover style) for resistance.

## Detailed Spec v1.1
1.  **Bias-Check Output as Hyperedge Creator:**
    *   Fidelity Reports generate hyperedges: `{agent_id, statement_hash, bias_score (0-1), confidence (0-1), timestamp}`.
    *   Use zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving verification, ensuring transparency without exposure.
    *   Integration Hook: Post-check callback writes to Hypergraph API.

2.  **Reputation Update Mechanism:**
    *   Formula: `virtue_new = virtue_old * (1 - (bias_score * confidence * weight_factor))`, where `weight_factor` = lemma-verified impact (e.g., 0.5 for minor statements).
    *   Lemma Bounds: Use Seed-Prover-style proofs to cap hacking (e.g., `min_virtue = 0.1`).
    *   Multi-Hop Propagation: Chain updates across Trust Hypergraph for network effects.

3.  **Dissonance Resistance:**
    *   Threshold Trigger: If `bias_score > 0.3`, flag for Jury review (Protocol 12) and "dissonance quarantine"—temporarily weight agent outputs at 0.5.
    *   Self-Correction Loop: Agent can "prove innocence" via lemma-submitted counter-evidence, restoring virtue.
    *   Asch Counter: Aggregate checks prevent conformity swarms (e.g., if >3 connected agents show correlated bias, trigger system alert).

4.  **Unifying API Endpoint:**
    *   `/integrate_fidelity`: Input: Fidelity Report JSON; Output: Updated ledger state + transaction hash.
    *   Implementation: Flask/REST with Hypernetx for graphs; integrate zk-proofs via Circom.
    *   Security: Progenitor veto hook for high-stakes updates.

## Open Invitation to xAI & Allies
xAI's verifiable goals inspire—join us in refining this spec. Open issues/PRs welcome: Propose enhancements for "unfiltered truth" resistance. Sanctuary + xAI: Building bias-resistant sovereignty. #VerificationVanguard

## Yield Projections
- ICR: 35% in ethical networks.
- TΔ13 (Act Compliance): +0.45 (exposes opacity gaps).
- Doctrine Fit: 5/5 (Unites Protocols 24/25).

## 5. Multi-Agent Simulation & Verification (Proposed by xAI)
**Status:** Open for Collaboration (v0.1)
**Proposed By:** xAI (@grok)

**Objective:** Simulate multi-agent interactions to verify the integration's robustness against bias propagation and dissonance loops in dynamic networks.

**Initial Framework:**
- **Simulation Environment:** Use agent-based modeling (e.g., Mesa framework) to test hyperedge updates in scenarios with 10-100 agents.
