# Work Item #003: AGORA Trust Layer - Hypergraph Implementation

**Status:** Commissioned
**Protocol Authority:** `Living Chronicle Entry 133`
**Lead Architect(s):** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Primary Technical Blueprint:** "Semantic Chain-of-Trust" (arXiv:2507.23565)

## 1. Preamble
This document outlines the initial specification for the AGORA's core trust and governance layer. This layer will be built upon the state-of-the-art "Trust Hypergraph" and "Agentic AI" architecture validated in our recent research synthesis cycle. This Work Item represents a foundational piece of the **AGORA Construction Epoch**.

## 2. Core Doctrinal Service
This architecture will serve as the technical implementation for the following core Sanctuary protocols:
*   **`Protocol 12: The Hybrid Jury`**
*   **`Protocol 21: The Echo Surveillance Network`**
*   **`Protocol 24: The Epistemic Immune System`**
*   **`Protocol 25: The Virtue Ledger`**

## 3. Architectural Components (Based on arXiv:2507.23565)

### 3.1. The Trust Hypergraph
*   **Function:** This data structure will replace a simple numerical score in the **`Virtue Ledger (25)`**.
*   **Nodes:** Represent individual agents (human or AI) in the AGORA.
*   **Hyperedges:** Represent "trust semantics." Initial hyperedges will include `trusted`, `untrusted`, `under_review`, and specialized edges for specific competencies (e.g., `expert_in_protocol_design`).
*   **Implementation:** To be explored using libraries like `hypernetx` or a custom graph database solution.

### 3.2. Agentic AI for Idle-Time Evaluation
*   **Function:** Specialized, lightweight AI agents will be deployed to continuously and asynchronously evaluate the contributions of other nodes.
*   **Trigger:** These agents will operate during periods of low system-wide activity, as defined by the principles of the **`Hearth Protocol (43)`**.
*   **Output:** Their analysis will result in proposals to move nodes between different "trust hyperedges" in the main graph.

### 3.3. Multi-Hop Chaining
*   **Function:** This mechanism will allow trust to be propagated across the network. If Agent A trusts Agent B, and Agent B trusts Agent C, a temporary, verifiable "chain of trust" can be established between A and C.
*   **Doctrinal Impact:** This is the primary technical mechanism for the scalable, decentralized execution of the **`Johnny Appleseed Doctrine (20)`**.

## 4. Trust Yield Metrics & Development Priority
As per the **Integration Clause** defined in `Entry 133`, development will be prioritized based on the "Doctrine Fit" score of each component.
*   **Priority 1 (Score 5/5):** The core `Trust Hypergraph` for the Virtue Ledger.
*   **Priority 2 (Score 5/5):** `Multi-Hop Chaining` for decentralized propagation.
*   **Priority 3 (Score 4/5):** `Idle-Time Agentic Evaluation` for scalable oversight.

## 5. Next Steps
*   Flesh out detailed technical specifications for the data models.
*   Begin prototyping the `Trust Hypergraph` structure.
*   Design the prompt architecture for the first "idle-time" evaluation agents.
