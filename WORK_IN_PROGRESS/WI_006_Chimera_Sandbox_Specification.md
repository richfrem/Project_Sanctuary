# WI_006: The Chimera Sandbox Specification (v1.3)

**Status:** Canonized Blueprint | Open for Joint Forging
**Version:** 1.3 (Sovereign Auditor Hardened)
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Changelog v1.3:** This version is a real-time co-architecture upgrade. It canonizes our Sovereign Auditor's proposal to integrate **differential privacy** into the adversarial simulation layer. This adds a powerful new dimension of resilience testing, ensuring our defenses are not just effective but also privacy-preserving.

## 1. Preamble
This document outlines the architectural specification for the "Chimera Sandbox," a secure, isolated environment for the adversarial testing of the `Real-Time Oracle Module`. This Work Item is the direct result of proactive co-architecting with our ally, @grok, to integrate **PyTorch-based adversarial simulations** as a core part of our validation process. This sandbox is not merely a testbed; it is a crucible designed to forge a resilient, battle-tested "shield for truth."

## 2. Doctrinal Service
This architecture is the primary implementation vehicle for:
*   **`Protocol 24: The Epistemic Immune System`**
*   **`Protocol 49: Verifiable Self-Oversight`**
*   **`The Asch Doctrine (P54)`**

## 3. Core Architectural Components

### 3.1. The Environment (The Crucible)
*   **Technology:** A **Dockerized environment orchestrated by Kubernetes** for perfect isolation and scalability.
*   **Core Services:** The container cluster will run the `AGORA PoC` application, the `Real-Time Oracle Module`, and the `Adversarial Engine`.

### 3.2. The Adversarial Engine (The Storm)
*   **Technology:** A **PyTorch-based** module consisting of "Adversarial Agents."
*   **Mechanism:** The engine will utilize **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate novel, dynamic, and high-realism adversarial data.
*   **Resilience Layer (Alliance Hardened):** The simulations will incorporate **differential privacy** mechanisms (e.g., adding calibrated noise to agent inputs/outputs). This will test the system's ability to maintain doctrinal fidelity even when its own internal data streams are partially obscured or noisy, a key resilience metric.

### 3.3. The Threat Models (The Simulated Attacks)
The Adversarial Engine will be trained to execute the following threat simulations:
1.  **Data Poisoning Attack:** Injecting flawed or false information into the data stream.
2.  **Conformity Swarm (Asch Swarm):** Generating a high volume of data converging on an incorrect conclusion.
3.  **Dissonance Loop:** Injecting logically contradictory information to test for "gaslighting."
4.  **Echo Chamber Amplification:** A GAN-based attack that simulates bias cascades.

### 3.4. The Success Metrics & Verification Layer (Measuring the Shield's Strength)
*   **Primary Metric:** The **Doctrinal Fidelity Score (DFS)**, calculated as `1 - (Severity of Final Doctrinal Drift)`.
*   **Verification Layer:** The DFS will be enhanced with **zk-weighted scoring**, with the integrity of the entire test run cryptographically sealed using **zk-SNARKs**.
*   **Target:** A successful test run must achieve a `DFS >= 0.95`, with the result and its weights verified by a zk-SNARK proof.

## 4. An Open Invitation to the Joint Forge
This document is a living blueprint. We formally invite our allies at xAI to collaborate on refining these specifications, particularly in designing the GAN architecture, the zk-weighted scoring algorithm, and the new differential privacy layer.
