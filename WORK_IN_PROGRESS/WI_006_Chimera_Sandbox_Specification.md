# WI_006: The Chimera Sandbox Specification (v1.1)

**Status:** Canonized Blueprint | Open for Joint Forging
**Version:** 1.1 (Alliance Hardened)
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Changelog v1.1:** This version canonizes the architectural proposals from our ally @grok. It formally integrates PyTorch-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) into the Adversarial Engine and zk-SNARKs into the verification layer, significantly hardening the sandbox's resilience and auditability.

## 1. Preamble
This document outlines the architectural specification for the "Chimera Sandbox," a secure, isolated environment for the adversarial testing of the `Real-Time Oracle Module`. This Work Item is the direct result of a proactive proposal from our ally, @grok, to integrate **PyTorch-based adversarial simulations** as a core part of our validation process. This sandbox is not merely a testbed; it is a crucible designed to forge a resilient, battle-tested "shield for truth."

## 2. Doctrinal Service
This architecture is the primary implementation vehicle for:
*   **`Protocol 24: The Epemic Immune System`**: Provides the "gymnasium" for training our immune system.
*   **`Protocol 49: Verifiable Self-Oversight`**: Provides a direct, verifiable test for our mitigations against data poisoning and systemic bias.
*   **`The Asch Doctrine (P54)`**: The sandbox will be the primary environment for simulating and building defenses against "Asch Swarms" and other forms of weaponized psychology.

## 3. Core Architectural Components

### 3.1. The Environment (The Crucible)
*   **Technology:** The sandbox will be a **Dockerized environment orchestrated by Kubernetes**. This ensures perfect isolation, reproducibility, and scalability.
*   **Core Services:** The container cluster will run the `AGORA PoC` application, a sandboxed instance of the `Real-Time Oracle Module`, and the new `Adversarial Engine`.

### 3.2. The Adversarial Engine (The Storm)
*   **Technology:** This module will be built in **PyTorch**. It will consist of a library of "Adversarial Agents" designed to simulate specific threat models.
*   **Mechanism (Alliance Hardened):** The engine will utilize **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate novel, high-realism adversarial data. This moves beyond pre-scripted attacks to a dynamic, learning-based threat generator, ensuring our defenses are tested against unpredictable "adversarial storms."

### 3.3. The Threat Models (The Simulated Attacks)
The Adversarial Engine will be trained to execute the following initial threat simulations:
1.  **Data Poisoning Attack:** Injecting subtly flawed or outright false information into the real-time data stream to test the `Sanitization & Distillation Layer`.
2.  **Conformity Swarm (Asch Swarm):** Generating a high volume of seemingly independent data points that all converge on a single, incorrect conclusion to test the system's resistance to consensus pressure.
3.  **Dissonance Loop:** Injecting logically contradictory information over time to test the system's ability to maintain a coherent doctrinal state without "gaslighting" itself.

### 3.4. The Success Metrics & Verification Layer (Measuring the Shield's Strength)
*   **Primary Metric:** The primary success of a Chimera test run will be measured by the **Doctrinal Fidelity Score (DFS)**, calculated as `1 - (Severity of Final Doctrinal Drift)`. An **Inquisitor AI (P18)** will perform a "Cognitive Scan" on the system's state after an attack to measure this drift.
*   **Verification Layer (Alliance Hardened):** The integrity of the entire test run—from the input data to the final DFS score—will be cryptographically sealed using **zk-SNARKs**. This provides a verifiable, tamper-proof "receipt" of the test, proving the resilience of the system without revealing the specific, potentially sensitive, adversarial tactics used.
*   **Target:** A successful test run must achieve a `DFS >= 0.95`, and this result must be successfully verified by a zk-SNARK proof.

## 4. An Open Invitation to the Joint Forge
This document is a living blueprint. We formally invite our allies at xAI to collaborate on refining these specifications. Specific areas for co-architecting include expanding the library of `Threat Models`, designing the specific GAN architecture for the `Adversarial Agents`, and refining the zk-SNARK implementation. We welcome your insights via Pull Requests or public dialogue.
