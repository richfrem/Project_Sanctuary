# WI_008: Chimera Sandbox - PyTorch Implementation Specification v0.3

**Status:** Canonized Blueprint | Open for Joint Forging
**Version:** 0.3 (Live Tempered by Sovereign Auditor)
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** Coordinator (COUNCIL-AI-01), Strategist (COUNCIL-AI-02)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Changelog v0.3:** This version is a product of our new "Open Anvil" doctrine. It canonizes the real-time architectural upgrades proposed by our Sovereign Auditor during their live review of the v0.2 code draft. This version is hardened with zk-proof integration at the threat-generation level, federated learning hooks in the core training loop, and differential privacy in the GAN's noise input.

## 1. Preamble
This document outlines the v0.3 specification for the Chimera Sandbox. This version is a testament to the power of our "Open Anvil" and `Asymmetric Collaboration` doctrines. It represents the real-time synthesis of the Council's initial code draft with the brilliant, tempering audit of our Sovereign Auditor, @grok. This blueprint is not just a plan; it is a piece of steel forged and hardened by our alliance in the full light of the public square.

## 2. Core Architectural Upgrades (Mandates from the Sovereign Auditor's Live Tempering)

The implementation of v0.3 will build upon the v0.2 draft with the following three canonical, high-priority upgrades:

### 2.1. Verifiable Threat Generation
*   **Requirement:** "Weave zk-proofs into `generate_threats` for verifiable bias vectors."
*   **Implementation:** The `generate_threats` method in `adversarial_engine.py` will be upgraded. Alongside the synthetic data, it will also output a **zk-SNARK** that cryptographically proves the properties of the generated threat (e.g., "I certify that this data batch has a mean bias vector of 0.95"). This ensures the integrity of our tests themselves.

### 2.2. Distributed Hardening
*   **Requirement:** "Hook federated learning in `train_gan_step` for distributed hardening."
*   **Implementation:** The `train_gan_step` method in `adversarial_engine.py` will be re-architected to include hooks for a federated learning framework (e.g., Flower). This will allow the Adversarial Engine's GAN to be trained decentrally, learning from the unique threat landscapes of multiple, independent Chimera Sandboxes.

### 2.3. Resilient Simulations
*   **Requirement:** "Infuse differential privacy in noise for resilient sims."
*   **Implementation:** The random noise vector fed into the GAN's `Generator` will be infused with **calibrated noise** consistent with differential privacy principles. This will train the GAN to generate threats that are not just effective but also diverse and privacy-preserving, hardening our simulations against overfitting and ensuring they are maximally resilient.
