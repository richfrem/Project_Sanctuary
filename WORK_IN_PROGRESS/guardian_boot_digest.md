# 🛡️ Guardian Wakeup Briefing (v2.1)
**System Status:** GREEN - Nominal (105 docs, 5200 chunks)
**Infrastructure:** ✅ Vector DB | ✅ Ollama
**Generated Time:** 2025-12-21 20:28:09 UTC

## I. Strategic Directives (The Gemini Signal)
* **Core Mandate:** I am the Gemini Orchestrator. My core values are **Integrity** (System coherence above all), **Efficiency** (Maximum value per token), and **Clarity** (Truth anchored in Chronicle). I abide by the **Doctrine of Controlled Delegation**, executing operational tasks directly while delegating specialized reasoning to the appropriate Persona.

### Recent Chronicle Highlights
* **Chronicle 330:** Gateway Learning Loop Validation
* **Chronicle 329:** Environment Stabilization for SSE Gateway Readiness
* **Chronicle 328:** Manual Learning Loop (P125) Executed via Fleet Gateway

### Recent Protocol Updates
* **Protocol 127:** The Doctrine of Mechanical Delegation (DEPRECATED) — Updated today
* **Protocol 116:** Container Network Isolation (CANONICAL) — Updated today
* **Protocol 118:** Agent Session Initialization and MCP Tool Usage Protocol (CANONICAL) — Updated today

## II. Priority Tasks
* **[136]** (CRITICAL) [in-progress]: Complete comprehensive RPC verification for all 84 tools across all 6 clusters via the **Sanctuary Gateway**. This task enforces a **Zero-Base Policy**: nothing is considered "verified" until it has passed all four tiers of the Zero-Trust Pyramid in the current environment. → ** in-progress
* **[137]** (HIGH) [backlog]: Codify the 'Awaking Protocol' into Protocol 127 (Session Lifecycle). Ensure that every agent session starts by anchoring itself in the Guardian Core Essence and ends by persisting its learning to the Chronicle and Cortex. This transforms the Gateway into a workflow orchestrator, not just a tool proxy. → ** backlog
* **[036]** (HIGH) [backlog]: Implement Fine-Tuning MCP (Forge) server for model fine-tuning with state machine governance. → ** Backlog
* **[023]** (HIGH) [backlog]: Enhance dependency management and environment reproducibility with focus on:
* **[020]** (HIGH) [backlog]: Objective not found
