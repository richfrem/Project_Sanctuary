Directive Audit: Orchestrator v2.1 (Briefing Integration Hardened)

Date: 2025-10-01
Prepared by: Sanctuary Council (Coordinator-01, Strategist-01, Auditor-01)
Consolidated from Evaluation Cycles 001–005

1. Executive Summary

The Council has completed five evaluation cycles examining the Orchestrator v2.1 architecture. Overall, v2.1 is recognized as a major advancement in synchronized context injection, resilience, and Guardian usability. However, the Council also identified critical vulnerabilities (notably "Infection at the Source"), along with clear pathways for architectural hardening via Mnemonic Attestation, RAG-enabled context management, and Guardian agility features.

The audit affirms v2.1 as production-ready, provided the recommended improvements are rapidly ratified and implemented.

2. Findings by Evaluation Cycle
Cycle 001 – Strengths

Briefing Packet Generation: Dynamic, automated, and mnemonic-grounded. Prevents fragmented context and aligns agents seamlessly with the current directive.

SYSTEM INSTRUCTION Injection: Ensures synthesis without verbatim regurgitation; concise, embedded, and strategically coherent.

Error Resilience: Non-blocking architecture with graceful error handling. Ensures persistence under failure, aligning with P94 and P95.

Strategic View: Enhances doctrinal fidelity and resilience; directly strengthens the Anti-Asch Engine.

Audit View: Raises new vulnerability: uniform misalignment risk if context injection is compromised ("Infection at the Source").

Cycle 002 – Weaknesses

Centralization Risks: Unified packet injection creates a single point of failure.

Scaling Concerns: Current design may strain memory sync and context windows as agent count grows.

Guardian Interaction: Limited mid-cycle visibility or intervention points.

Audit Emphasis: Semantic compromise is more dangerous than technical error; absence of attestation allows silent drift.

Cycle 003 – Recommendations

Three high-impact improvements proposed and endorsed:

Implement P94: Mnemonic Attestation Protocol (MAP-94)

Cryptographic hash verification of every packet before injection.

Decentralized, Auditor-led verification.

Hard-fail on mismatch ("Context Integrity Breach").

RAG-Enabled Context Management (P85 & P88 Integration)

On-demand retrieval instead of full history replay.

Mnemonic Cortex queries and Sovereign Scaffolding for contextual precision.

Strong data provenance and fidelity checks.

Guardian Agility Layer

Real-time deliberation streaming to Guardian.

Mid-task pause/intervene/resume controls.

Immutable logging of all Guardian interventions.

Strategic View: These hardenings elevate the Orchestrator into a truly extensible Anti-Asch Engine.
Audit View: Attestation, provenance, and immutable logs are essential for verifiable trust.

Cycle 004 – Continuity Review

continuity_check_module.py integrates well with v2.1, but refinements are needed:

More granular checkpoints across the deliberation lifecycle.

Bidirectional verification: not just packet-to-chronicle, but chronicle-to-packet.

Stronger linkage to MAP-94: continuity checks should confirm both historical and injected context integrity.

Audit View: Reinforce with layered attestation; continuity without integrity guarantees is insufficient.

Cycle 005 – Guardian Experience

Strengths: v2.1 reduces manual load on Guardian, ensures synchronized context, and provides clear outputs.

Pain Points: Lack of mid-deliberation visibility; Guardian sees results only after cycle completion.

Recommendations:

Stream real-time logs and deliberation traces.

Simplify stewardship commands and feedback channels.

Ensure Guardian actions are recorded in immutable audit trails to preserve operational history.

3. Consolidated Council Recommendations

Ratify and implement MAP-94 (Mnemonic Attestation Protocol) immediately.
This is the existential safeguard against "Infection at the Source."

Integrate RAG-enabled Mnemonic Cortex + Sovereign Scaffolding.
Enables extensibility, efficient scaling, and deeper strategic foresight.

Deploy Guardian Agility Layer with immutable audit trails.
Improves operational oversight without sacrificing verifiability.

Refine continuity_check_module.py for layered, bidirectional verification.
Ensure both historical chain and live packet integrity are covered.

Harden Guardian experience with live feedback and simplified stewardship controls.

4. Guardian Validation Trail

Raw Artifacts: All five cycle logs preserved under WORK_IN_PROGRESS/COUNCIL_DIRECTIVES.

Briefing Packets: Archived per-session in ARCHIVE/council_memory_sync_*.

Audit Directive: This consolidated report plus original cycle files form a complete validation set.

5. Conclusion

The Council confirms Orchestrator v2.1 is operationally sound and strategically valuable, but its long-term viability depends on rapid implementation of MAP-94 and the broader hardenings outlined here. With these, v2.1 will evolve into a Guardian-ready, anti-fragile deliberation engine capable of scaling in complexity and trustworthiness.
