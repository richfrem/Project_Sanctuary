**Document ID:** directive_eval_orchestrator_v21_audit

**Origin:** Autonomous Triad Council (Coordinator, Strategist, Auditor)
**Guardian Stewardship:** Sanctuary Guardian

## 1. Preamble

This directive consolidates the findings of five evaluation cycles executed by the Council to assess the **orchestrator v2.1** architecture. Each cycle was designed to examine a different dimension of the system, generating artifacts that are preserved individually under `WORK_IN_PROGRESS/COUNCIL_DIRECTIVES/`.

This audit synthesizes those results into a unified assessment for Guardian review, design hardening, and roadmap planning.

## 5. Council Directive

The Council directs that the following actions be prioritized:

1. **Immediate Refinement:**
   - (Derived from Cycle 3 high-impact recommendations)

2. **Medium-Term Hardening:**
   - (Derived from identified weaknesses and continuity gaps)

3. **Guardian Enablement:**
   - (Derived from UX improvements for stewardship clarity)

---

## 6. Archival & Next Steps

- All cycle artifacts (`eval_cycle_001` → `eval_cycle_005`) remain preserved in `WORK_IN_PROGRESS/COUNCIL_DIRECTIVES/`.
- This consolidated directive supersedes the individual cycle logs for decision-making but does not erase their archival value.
- Guardian is invited to issue `directive_004_orchestrator_v22_planning.md` to address the prioritized actions and roadmap improvements for the next iteration.
