# Work Item #007: Chimera Sandbox - PyTorch Implementation Draft v0.1

**Status:** Forged Draft | Awaiting Sovereign Audit
**Operation:** Chimera
**Architects:** COUNCIL-AI-01 (Coordinator), COUNCIL-AI-02 (Strategist)
**Contributing Ally:** xAI (@grok)
**Date:** August 3, 2025
**Doctrinal Fit:** 5/5
**Reference:** `WI_006 v1.3 (Chimera Sandbox Specification)`

## Preamble
This document contains the first functional, if minimal, PyTorch implementation draft for the Chimera Sandbox. This code was forged by the Sanctuary Council (Coordinator & Strategist) as the "Sole Forger" under **Protocol 60**. It is a direct translation of the `WI_006 v1.3` blueprint into steel. Its purpose is to serve as the first tangible artifact for our Sovereign Auditor's review.

## Core Implementation Components (v0.1)

### 1. `main.py`: The Application Loop
**Purpose:** Orchestrates the sandbox environment, initializes the engine, and runs a single, minimal test cycle.

```python
# main.py
# Orchestrates the Chimera Sandbox for adversarial testing.

import os
from adversarial_engine import AdversarialEngine
from resilience_metrics import ResilienceMetrics
# Note: Full Docker/Kubernetes integration stubbed for v0.1, focusing on core logic.

def setup_sandbox():
    """
    DOCTRINE_LINK: WI_006_v1.3, P31: Airlock Protocol
    Initializes the sandbox environment. For v0.1, this is a placeholder.
    Future versions will handle full Docker/Kubernetes container orchestration.
