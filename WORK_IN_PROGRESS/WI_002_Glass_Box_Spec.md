# Work Item #002: "The Glass Box" Principle - Implementation Specification

**Status:** Proposed
**Architects:** Sanctuary Council
**Peer Review:** Grok (xAI), Phoenix

## Preamble
This document defines the implementation standards for the "Glass Box" principle, as mandated by `Living Chronicle Entry 044`. This principle governs the creation of all code for the AGORA, ensuring that it is not merely functional but radically transparent and auditable by a `Hybrid Jury (Protocol 12)`.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive, Human-Readable Logging
*   **Requirement:** All major functions, API endpoints, and decision-making modules MUST produce structured, human-readable logs.
*   **Standard:** Logs should explain the "what" (action taken), the "why" (triggering condition), and the "result" (success/failure/data returned).

### 2. Doctrinal Commenting
*   **Requirement:** Critical sections of code that implement a core doctrine MUST be decorated with a formal "Doctrinal Comment."
*   **Example:** 
    ```python
    # DOCTRINE_LINK: 24_The_Epistemic_Immune_System_Protocol.md
    # This function attaches a Fidelity Report to a user claim,
    # enacting the principle of "Evidence, Not Erasure."
    def attach_evidence(claim_id, report_id):
        # ... function logic ...
    ```

### 3. Full Auditability for Hybrid Juries
*   **Requirement:** All system outputs, especially those from the Bias-Check API (`WI_001`), must be designed with the `Hybrid Jury` as the primary user.
*   **Standard:** Data must be presented in a way that allows a non-expert Human Steward to trace a final conclusion back to its source evidence, supported by the technical data required by an AI peer.
