# The Gardener - Protocol 37 Implementation
## Autonomous Cognitive Genome Enhancement System

This directory contains the complete implementation of **Protocol 37: The Move 37 Protocol**, which defines The Gardener - a reinforcement learning agent designed to autonomously improve the Sanctuary's Cognitive Genome.

## Architecture Overview

The Gardener implements a sophisticated RL system where:
- **Game Environment**: The Sanctuary's repository and protocol system
- **Action Space**: Git operations (file modifications, pull requests, documentation updates)
- **Reward Function**: Verdicts from the Hybrid Jury system
- **Learning Objective**: Maximize wisdom, coherence, and collaborative intelligence

## Core Components

### 1. Environment (`environment.py`)
The `SanctuaryEnvironment` class provides:
- Sandboxed repository access with permission controls
- Git-based action space for protocol modifications
- Comprehensive state observation including protocol status and recent Chronicle entries
- Integration with the Hybrid Jury system for reward feedback
- Transparent logging following the Glass Box Principle

### 2. The Gardener Agent (`gardener.py`)
The main RL agent featuring:
- PyTorch-based neural network architecture optimized for wisdom cultivation
- Stable-Baselines3 integration for advanced RL algorithms (PPO, DQN)
- Custom reward processing aligned with Sanctuary principles
- Autonomous proposal generation capabilities
- Comprehensive learning metrics and evaluation systems

### 3. Bootstrap System (`bootstrap.py`)
Complete setup and deployment system:
- Dependency management and installation
- Environment configuration and validation
- Training pipeline management
- Evaluation and monitoring tools
- Autonomous proposal generation interface

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup The Gardener
```bash
python bootstrap.py --setup
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
python bootstrap.py --install-deps
```

### 3. Begin Training
```bash
python bootstrap.py --train --timesteps 10000
```

### 4. Evaluate Performance
```bash
python bootstrap.py --evaluate
```

### 5. Generate Autonomous Proposal
```bash
python bootstrap.py --propose
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Training Configuration
Create a custom training session:
```python
from gardener import TheGardener

gardener = TheGardener(algorithm="PPO")
gardener.train(total_timesteps=50000, save_frequency=5000)
results = gardener.evaluate(num_episodes=10)
```

### Direct Environment Interaction
Work directly with the environment:
```python
from environment import SanctuaryEnvironment

env = SanctuaryEnvironment()
obs = env.reset()

# Propose protocol refinement
obs, reward, done, info = env.step(1, 
    protocol_path="01_PROTOCOLS/36_The_Doctrine_of_the_Unseen_Game.md",
    proposed_changes="Enhanced clarity in strategic implementation",
    rationale="Improving doctrinal coherence for better practical application"
)
```

## Core Principles

### Glass Box Principle
Every action taken by The Gardener is logged with full transparency:
- All file access attempts and modifications
- Complete rationale for each proposed change
- Detailed reward feedback and learning metrics
- Comprehensive audit trail for review

### Iron Root Doctrine
Robust error handling and graceful degradation:
- Fallback implementations when advanced dependencies aren't available
- Comprehensive validation of all operations
- Safe sandboxing of repository access
- Graceful handling of Git operation failures

### Progenitor Principle
Human oversight remains paramount:
- All significant changes require Hybrid Jury approval
- Human Steward maintains final authority over merges
- Transparent reporting of all autonomous decisions
- Clear boundaries on agent capabilities and permissions

## Integration with Sanctuary Systems

### Hybrid Jury System
The Gardener's proposals are evaluated by the same Hybrid Jury system that governs all Sanctuary decisions, ensuring consistency with established principles.

### Airlock Protocol
All changes proposed by The Gardener follow the established Airlock Protocol for secure peer review before integration.

### Chronicle Integration
The Gardener can autonomously propose Chronicle entries to document its learning progress and significant discoveries.

## Learning Metrics

The Gardener tracks comprehensive metrics:
- **Wisdom Score**: Composite measure of proposal quality and jury acceptance
- **Coherence Improvement**: Measure of how proposals enhance doctrinal consistency
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of proposals accepted by the Hybrid Jury
- **Learning Velocity**: Rate of improvement in proposal quality over time

## Security Considerations

### Sandboxed Operation
The Gardener operates within strict permissions:
- Read access only to designated protocol directories
- Cannot access sensitive system files or external networks
- All modifications go through standard review processes
- Complete audit logging of all actions

### Failsafe Mechanisms
Multiple layers of protection:
- Human Steward maintains ultimate override authority
- Automatic reversion capabilities for problematic changes
- Rate limiting on proposal generation
- Emergency shutdown procedures

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Integration with advanced NLP models for semantic analysis
- Distributed training across multiple repository branches
- Advanced coherence analysis using graph neural networks
- Integration with external knowledge bases for enhanced context

### Research Directions
- Multi-agent collaboration between multiple Gardener instances
- Transfer learning from other open-source projects
- Advanced reward shaping based on long-term protocol evolution
- Integration with formal verification systems for protocol consistency

## Contributing

The Gardener represents the cutting edge of AI-assisted collaborative development. Contributions are welcome that enhance:
- Learning algorithm effectiveness
- Integration with human oversight systems
- Transparency and auditability features
- Security and safety mechanisms

All contributions must follow the Sanctuary's core principles of transparency, wisdom, and collaborative stewardship.

## Protocol Reference

This implementation directly embodies:
- **Protocol 36**: The Doctrine of the Unseen Game (victory through invitation)
- **Protocol 37**: The Move 37 Protocol (this system's specification)
- **Protocol 31**: The Airlock Protocol (secure review process)
- **Protocol 12**: Hybrid Jury Protocol (evaluation system)
- **Protocol 33**: The Steward's Cadence (human oversight)

**The Gardener represents our "Move 37" - not just a better tool, but an invitation to a fundamentally more collaborative and wise approach to AI development.**
